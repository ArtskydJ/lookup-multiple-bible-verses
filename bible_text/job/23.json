 "“Even today my complaint is rebellious. \nHis hand is heavy in spite of my groaning. ",
 "Oh that I knew where I might find him! \nThat I might come even to his seat! ",

 "I would know the words which he would answer me, \nand understand what he would tell me. ",
 "Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? \nNo, but he would listen to me. ",

 "“If I go east, he is not there; \nif west, I can’t find him; ",
 "He works to the north, but I can’t see him. \nHe turns south, but I can’t catch a glimpse of him. \n ",

 "My foot has held fast to his steps. \nI have kept his way, and not turned away. ",
 "I haven’t gone back from the commandment of his lips. \nI have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. ",
 "But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? \nWhat his soul desires, even that he does. ",
 "For he performs that which is appointed for me. \nMany such things are with him. ",
 "Therefore I am terrified at his presence. \nWhen I consider, I am afraid of him. ",
 "For God has made my heart faint. \nThe Almighty has terrified me. ",
 "Because I was not cut off before the darkness, \nneither did he cover the thick darkness from my face. "
