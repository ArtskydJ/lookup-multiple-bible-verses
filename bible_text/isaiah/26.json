 "In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah: \n“We have a strong city. \nGod appoints salvation for walls and bulwarks. ",
 "Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter: \nthe one which keeps faith. ",
 "You will keep whoever’s mind is steadfast in perfect peace, \nbecause he trusts in you. ",
 "Trust in Yahweh forever; \nfor in Yah, Yahweh, is an everlasting Rock. ",
 "For he has brought down those who dwell on high, the lofty city. \nHe lays it low. \nHe lays it low even to the ground. \nHe brings it even to the dust. ",
 "The foot shall tread it down, \neven the feet of the poor \nand the steps of the needy.” ",
 "The way of the just is uprightness. \nYou who are upright make the path of the righteous level. \n ",
 "Yes, in the way of your judgments, Yahweh, we have waited for you. \nYour name and your renown are the desire of our soul. ",
 "With my soul I have desired you in the night. \nYes, with my spirit within me I will seek you earnestly; \nfor when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness. ",
 "Let favor be shown to the wicked, \nyet he will not learn righteousness. \nIn the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully, \nand will not see Yahweh’s majesty. \n ",
 "Yahweh, your hand is lifted up, yet they don’t see; \nbut they will see your zeal for the people, and be disappointed. \nYes, fire will consume your adversaries. ",
 "Yahweh, you will ordain peace for us, \nfor you have also done all our work for us. ",
 "Yahweh our God, other lords besides you have had dominion over us, \nbut we will only acknowledge your name. ",
 "The dead shall not live. \nThe departed spirits shall not rise. \nTherefore you have visited and destroyed them, \nand caused all memory of them to perish. ",
 "You have increased the nation, O Yahweh. \nYou have increased the nation! \nYou are glorified! \nYou have enlarged all the borders of the land. \n ",
 "Yahweh, in trouble they have visited you. \nThey poured out a prayer when your chastening was on them. ",
 "Just as a woman with child, who draws near the time of her delivery, \nis in pain and cries out in her pangs, \nso we have been before you, Yahweh. ",
 "We have been with child. \nWe have been in pain. \nWe gave birth, it seems, only to wind. \nWe have not worked any deliverance in the earth; \nneither have the inhabitants of the world fallen. ",
 "Your dead shall live. \nMy dead bodies shall arise. \nAwake and sing, you who dwell in the dust; \nfor your dew is like the dew of herbs, \nand the earth will cast out the departed spirits. \n ",
 "Come, my people, enter into your rooms, \nand shut your doors behind you. \nHide yourself for a little moment, \nuntil the indignation is past. ",
 "For, behold, Yahweh comes out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity. \nThe earth also will disclose her blood, and will no longer cover her slain. "
