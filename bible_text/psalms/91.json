 " \nHe who dwells in the secret place of the Most High \nwill rest in the shadow of the Almighty. ",
 "I will say of Yahweh, “He is my refuge and my fortress; \nmy God, in whom I trust.” ",
 "For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler, \nand from the deadly pestilence. ",
 "He will cover you with his feathers. \nUnder his wings you will take refuge. \nHis faithfulness is your shield and rampart. ",
 "You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, \nnor of the arrow that flies by day, ",
 "nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, \nnor of the destruction that wastes at noonday. ",
 "A thousand may fall at your side, \nand ten thousand at your right hand; \nbut it will not come near you. ",
 "You will only look with your eyes, \nand see the recompense of the wicked. ",
 "Because you have made Yahweh your refuge, \nand the Most High your dwelling place, ",
 "no evil shall happen to you, \nneither shall any plague come near your dwelling. ",
 "For he will put his angels in charge of you, \nto guard you in all your ways. ",
 "They will bear you up in their hands, \nso that you won’t dash your foot against a stone. ",
 "You will tread on the lion and cobra. \nYou will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot. ",
 "“Because he has set his love on me, therefore I will deliver him. \nI will set him on high, because he has known my name. ",
 "He will call on me, and I will answer him. \nI will be with him in trouble. \nI will deliver him, and honor him. ",
 "I will satisfy him with long life, \nand show him my salvation.” "
