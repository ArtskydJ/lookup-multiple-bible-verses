 " \nWho is this who comes from Edom, \nwith dyed garments from Bozrah? \nWho is this who is glorious in his clothing, \nmarching in the greatness of his strength? \n“It is I who speak in righteousness, \nmighty to save.” ",
 "Why is your clothing red, \nand your garments like him who treads in the wine vat? \n ",
 "“I have trodden the wine press alone. \nOf the peoples, no one was with me. \nYes, I trod them in my anger \nand trampled them in my wrath. \nTheir lifeblood is sprinkled on my garments, \nand I have stained all my clothing. ",
 "For the day of vengeance was in my heart, \nand the year of my redeemed has come. ",
 "I looked, and there was no one to help; \nand I wondered that there was no one to uphold. \nTherefore my own arm brought salvation to me. \nMy own wrath upheld me. ",
 "I trod down the peoples in my anger \nand made them drunk in my wrath. \nI poured their lifeblood out on the earth.” \n ",
 "I will tell of the loving kindnesses of Yahweh \nand the praises of Yahweh, \naccording to all that Yahweh has given to us, \nand the great goodness toward the house of Israel, \nwhich he has given to them according to his mercies, \nand according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses. ",
 "For he said, “Surely, they are my people, \nchildren who will not deal falsely;” \nso he became their Savior. ",
 "In all their affliction he was afflicted, \nand the angel of his presence saved them. \nIn his love and in his pity he redeemed them. \nHe bore them, \nand carried them all the days of old. \n ",
 "But they rebelled \nand grieved his Holy Spirit. \nTherefore he turned and became their enemy, \nand he himself fought against them. \n ",
 "Then he remembered the days of old, \nMoses and his people, saying, \n“Where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? \nWhere is he who put his Holy Spirit among them?” ",
 "Who caused his glorious arm to be at Moses’ right hand? \nWho divided the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name? ",
 "Who led them through the depths, \nlike a horse in the wilderness, \nso that they didn’t stumble? ",
 "As the livestock that go down into the valley, \nYahweh’s Spirit caused them to rest. \nSo you led your people to make yourself a glorious name. \n ",
 "Look down from heaven, \nand see from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory. \nWhere are your zeal and your mighty acts? \nThe yearning of your heart and your compassion is restrained toward me. ",
 "For you are our Father, \nthough Abraham doesn’t know us, \nand Israel does not acknowledge us. \nYou, Yahweh, are our Father. \nOur Redeemer from everlasting is your name. ",
 "O Yahweh, why do you make us wander from your ways, \nand harden our heart from your fear? \nReturn for your servants’ sake, \nthe tribes of your inheritance. ",
 "Your holy people possessed it but a little while. \nOur adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary. ",
 "We have become like those over whom you never ruled, \nlike those who were not called by your name. "
