 " \nThe fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.” \nThey are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity. \nThere is no one who does good. ",
 "God looks down from heaven on the children of men, \nto see if there are any who understood, \nwho seek after God. ",
 "Every one of them has gone back. \nThey have become filthy together. \nThere is no one who does good, no, not one. ",
 "Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, \nwho eat up my people as they eat bread, \nand don’t call on God? ",
 "There they were in great fear, where no fear was, \nfor God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you. \nYou have put them to shame, \nbecause God has rejected them. ",
 "Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! \nWhen God brings back his people from captivity, \nthen Jacob shall rejoice, \nand Israel shall be glad. "
