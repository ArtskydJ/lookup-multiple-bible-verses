 "Listen to this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel. \n ",
 "“The virgin of Israel has fallen; \nShe shall rise no more. \nShe is cast down on her land; \nthere is no one to raise her up.” ",
 "For the Lord Yahweh says: \n“The city that went out a thousand shall have a hundred left, \nand that which went out one hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel.” ",
 "For Yahweh says to the house of Israel: \n“Seek me, and you will live; ",
 "but don’t seek Bethel, \nnor enter into Gilgal, \nand don’t pass to Beersheba: \nfor Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, \nand Bethel shall come to nothing. ",
 "Seek Yahweh, and you will live; \nlest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, \nand it devour, and there be no one to quench it in Bethel. ",
 "You who turn justice to wormwood, \nand cast down righteousness to the earth: ",
 "seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion, \nand turns the shadow of death into the morning, \nand makes the day dark with night; \nwho calls for the waters of the sea, \nand pours them out on the surface of the earth, Yahweh is his name, ",
 "who brings sudden destruction on the strong, \nso that destruction comes on the fortress. ",
 "They hate him who reproves in the gate, \nand they abhor him who speaks blamelessly. ",
 "Therefore, because you trample on the poor, \nand take taxes from him of wheat: \nYou have built houses of cut stone, \nbut you will not dwell in them. \nYou have planted pleasant vineyards, \nbut you shall not drink their wine. ",
 "For I know how many your offenses, \nand how great are your sins— \nyou who afflict the just, \nwho take a bribe, \nand who turn away the needy in the courts. ",
 "Therefore a prudent person keeps silent in such a time, \nfor it is an evil time. ",
 "Seek good, and not evil, \nthat you may live; \nand so Yahweh, the God of Armies, will be with you, \nas you say. ",
 "Hate evil, love good, \nand establish justice in the courts. \nIt may be that Yahweh, the God of Armies, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.” ",
 "Therefore Yahweh, the God of Armies, the Lord, says: \n“Wailing will be in all the wide ways; \nand they will say in all the streets, ‘Alas! Alas!’ \nand they will call the farmer to mourning, \nand those who are skillful in lamentation to wailing. ",
 "In all vineyards there will be wailing; \nfor I will pass through the middle of you,” says Yahweh. ",
 "“Woe to you who desire the day of Yahweh! \nWhy do you long for the day of Yahweh? \nIt is darkness, \nand not light. ",
 "As if a man fled from a lion, \nand a bear met him; \nOr he went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, \nand a snake bit him. ",
 "Won’t the day of Yahweh be darkness, and not light? \nEven very dark, and no brightness in it? ",
 "I hate, I despise your feasts, \nand I can’t stand your solemn assemblies. ",
 "Yes, though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings, \nI will not accept them; \nneither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals. ",
 "Take away from me the noise of your songs! \nI will not listen to the music of your harps. ",
 "But let justice roll on like rivers, \nand righteousness like a mighty stream. ",
 "“Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, house of Israel?  ",
 "You also carried the tent of your king and the shrine of your images, the star of your god, which you made for yourselves.  ",
 "Therefore I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,” says Yahweh, whose name is the God of Armies. "
