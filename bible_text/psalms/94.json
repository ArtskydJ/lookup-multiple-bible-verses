 " \nYahweh, you God to whom vengeance belongs, \nyou God to whom vengeance belongs, shine out. ",
 "Rise up, you judge of the earth. \nPay back the proud what they deserve. ",
 "Yahweh, how long will the wicked, \nhow long will the wicked triumph? ",
 "They pour out arrogant words. \nAll the evildoers boast. ",
 "They break your people in pieces, Yahweh, \nand afflict your heritage. ",
 "They kill the widow and the alien, \nand murder the fatherless. ",
 "They say, “Yah will not see, \nneither will Jacob’s God consider.” ",
 "Consider, you senseless among the people; \nyou fools, when will you be wise? ",
 "He who implanted the ear, won’t he hear? \nHe who formed the eye, won’t he see? ",
 "He who disciplines the nations, won’t he punish? \nHe who teaches man knows. ",
 "Yahweh knows the thoughts of man, \nthat they are futile. ",
 "Blessed is the man whom you discipline, Yah, \nand teach out of your law, ",
 "that you may give him rest from the days of adversity, \nuntil the pit is dug for the wicked. ",
 "For Yahweh won’t reject his people, \nneither will he forsake his inheritance. ",

 "In the multitude of my thoughts within me, \nyour comforts delight my soul. ",
 "Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you, \nwhich brings about mischief by statute? ",
 "They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, \nand condemn the innocent blood. ",
 "But Yahweh has been my high tower, \nmy God, the rock of my refuge. ",
 "He has brought on them their own iniquity, \nand will cut them off in their own wickedness. \nYahweh, our God, will cut them off. "
