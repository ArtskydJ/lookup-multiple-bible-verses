 "Then Job answered, \n ",
 "“No doubt, but you are the people, \nand wisdom will die with you. ",
 "But I have understanding as well as you; \nI am not inferior to you. \nYes, who doesn’t know such things as these? ",
 "I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor, \nI, who called on God, and he answered. \nThe just, the blameless man is a joke. ",
 "In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune. \nIt is ready for them whose foot slips. ",
 "The tents of robbers prosper. \nThose who provoke God are secure, \nwho carry their god in their hands. \n ",
 "“But ask the animals, now, and they will teach you; \nthe birds of the sky, and they will tell you. ",
 "Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you. \nThe fish of the sea will declare to you. ",
 "Who doesn’t know that in all these, \nYahweh’s hand has done this, ",
 "in whose hand is the life of every living thing, \nand the breath of all mankind? ",
 "Doesn’t the ear try words, \neven as the palate tastes its food? ",
 "With aged men is wisdom, \nin length of days understanding. \n ",
 "“With God is wisdom and might. \nHe has counsel and understanding. ",
 "Behold, he breaks down, and it can’t be built again. \nHe imprisons a man, and there can be no release. ",
 "Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up. \nAgain, he sends them out, and they overturn the earth. ",
 "With him is strength and wisdom. \nThe deceived and the deceiver are his. ",
 "He leads counselors away stripped. \nHe makes judges fools. ",
 "He loosens the bond of kings. \nHe binds their waist with a belt. ",
 "He leads priests away stripped, \nand overthrows the mighty. ",
 "He removes the speech of those who are trusted, \nand takes away the understanding of the elders. ",
 "He pours contempt on princes, \nand loosens the belt of the strong. ",
 "He uncovers deep things out of darkness, \nand brings out to light the shadow of death. ",
 "He increases the nations, and he destroys them. \nHe enlarges the nations, and he leads them captive. ",
 "He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth, \nand causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way. ",
 "They grope in the dark without light. \nHe makes them stagger like a drunken man. "
