 "Take away the wicked from the king’s presence, \nand his throne will be established in righteousness. ",
 "Don’t exalt yourself in the presence of the king, \nor claim a place among great men; ",

 "Don’t be hasty in bringing charges to court. \nWhat will you do in the end when your neighbor shames you? ",
 "Debate your case with your neighbor, \nand don’t betray the confidence of another, ",
 "lest one who hears it put you to shame, \nand your bad reputation never depart. \n ",
 "A word fitly spoken \nis like apples of gold in settings of silver. ",
 "As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, \nso is a wise reprover to an obedient ear. ",

 "for you will heap coals of fire on his head, \nand Yahweh will reward you. ",
 "The north wind produces rain; \nso a backbiting tongue brings an angry face. ",
