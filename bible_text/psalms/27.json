 " \nYahweh is my light and my salvation. \nWhom shall I fear? \nYahweh is the strength of my life. \nOf whom shall I be afraid? ",
 "When evildoers came at me to eat up my flesh, \neven my adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell. ",
 "Though an army should encamp against me, \nmy heart shall not fear. \nThough war should rise against me, \neven then I will be confident. ",
 "One thing I have asked of Yahweh, that I will seek after: \nthat I may dwell in Yahweh’s house all the days of my life, \nto see Yahweh’s beauty, \nand to inquire in his temple. ",
 "For in the day of trouble, he will keep me secretly in his pavilion. \nIn the secret place of his tabernacle, he will hide me. \nHe will lift me up on a rock. ",
 "Now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me. \nI will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent. \nI will sing, yes, I will sing praises to Yahweh. \n ",
 "Hear, Yahweh, when I cry with my voice. \nHave mercy also on me, and answer me. ",
 "When you said, “Seek my face,” \nmy heart said to you, “I will seek your face, Yahweh.” ",
 "Don’t hide your face from me. \nDon’t put your servant away in anger. \nYou have been my help. \nDon’t abandon me, \nneither forsake me, God of my salvation. ",
 "When my father and my mother forsake me, \nthen Yahweh will take me up. ",
 "Teach me your way, Yahweh. \nLead me in a straight path, because of my enemies. ",
 "Don’t deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries, \nfor false witnesses have risen up against me, \nsuch as breathe out cruelty. ",
 "I am still confident of this: \nI will see the goodness of Yahweh in the land of the living. ",
 "Wait for Yahweh. \nBe strong, and let your heart take courage. \nYes, wait for Yahweh. "
