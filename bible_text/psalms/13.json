 " \nHow long, Yahweh? \nWill you forget me forever? \nHow long will you hide your face from me? ",
 "How long shall I take counsel in my soul, \nhaving sorrow in my heart every day? \nHow long shall my enemy triumph over me? ",
 "Behold, and answer me, Yahweh, my God. \nGive light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death; ",
 "lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him;” \nlest my adversaries rejoice when I fall. \n ",
 "But I trust in your loving kindness. \nMy heart rejoices in your salvation. ",
 "I will sing to Yahweh, \nbecause he has been good to me. "
