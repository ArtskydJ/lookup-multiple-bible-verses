 " \nOh that you would tear the heavens, \nthat you would come down, \nthat the mountains might quake at your presence. ",
 "As when fire kindles the brushwood, \nand the fire causes the water to boil; \nMake your name known to your adversaries, \nthat the nations may tremble at your presence! ",
 "When you did awesome things which we didn’t look for, \nyou came down, and the mountains quaked at your presence. ",
 "For from of old men have not heard, \nnor perceived by the ear, \nnor has the eye seen a God besides you, \nwho works for him who waits for him. ",
 "You meet him who rejoices and does righteousness, \nthose who remember you in your ways. \nBehold, you were angry, and we sinned. \nWe have been in sin for a long time. \nShall we be saved? ",
 "For we have all become like one who is unclean, \nand all our righteousness is like a polluted garment. \nWe all fade like a leaf; \nand our iniquities, like the wind, take us away. ",
 "There is no one who calls on your name, \nwho stirs himself up to take hold of you; \nfor you have hidden your face from us, \nand have consumed us by means of our iniquities. \n ",
 "But now, Yahweh, you are our Father. \nWe are the clay and you our potter. \nWe all are the work of your hand. ",
 "Don’t be furious, Yahweh. \nDon’t remember iniquity forever. \nLook and see, we beg you, \nwe are all your people. ",
 "Your holy cities have become a wilderness. \nZion has become a wilderness, \nJerusalem a desolation. ",
 "Our holy and our beautiful house where our fathers praised you \nis burned with fire. \nAll our pleasant places are laid waste. ",
 "Will you hold yourself back for these things, Yahweh? \nWill you keep silent and punish us very severely? "
