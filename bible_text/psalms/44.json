 " \nWe have heard with our ears, God; \nour fathers have told us what work you did in their days, \nin the days of old. ",
 "You drove out the nations with your hand, \nbut you planted them. \nYou afflicted the peoples, \nbut you spread them abroad. ",
 "For they didn’t get the land in possession by their own sword, \nneither did their own arm save them; \nbut your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face, \nbecause you were favorable to them. ",
 "You are my King, God. \nCommand victories for Jacob! ",
 "Through you, will we push down our adversaries. \nThrough your name, we will tread down those who rise up against us. ",
 "For I will not trust in my bow, \nneither shall my sword save me. ",
 "But you have saved us from our adversaries, \nand have shamed those who hate us. ",
 "In God we have made our boast all day long, \nwe will give thanks to your name forever. \n ",
 "But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonor, \nand don’t go out with our armies. ",
 "You make us turn back from the adversary. \nThose who hate us take plunder for themselves. ",
 "You have made us like sheep for food, \nand have scattered us among the nations. ",
 "You sell your people for nothing, \nand have gained nothing from their sale. ",
 "You make us a reproach to our neighbors, \na scoffing and a derision to those who are around us. ",
 "You make us a byword among the nations, \na shaking of the head among the peoples. ",
 "All day long my dishonor is before me, \nand shame covers my face, ",
 "at the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses, \nbecause of the enemy and the avenger. ",
 "All this has come on us, \nyet we haven’t forgotten you. \nWe haven’t been false to your covenant. ",
 "Our heart has not turned back, \nneither have our steps strayed from your path, ",
 "though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals, \nand covered us with the shadow of death. ",
 "If we have forgotten the name of our God, \nor spread out our hands to a strange god, ",
 "won’t God search this out? \nFor he knows the secrets of the heart. ",
 "Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long. \nWe are regarded as sheep for the slaughter. ",
 "Wake up! \nWhy do you sleep, Lord? \nArise! \nDon’t reject us forever. ",
 "Why do you hide your face, \nand forget our affliction and our oppression? ",
 "For our soul is bowed down to the dust. \nOur body clings to the earth. ",
 "Rise up to help us. \nRedeem us for your loving kindness’ sake. "
