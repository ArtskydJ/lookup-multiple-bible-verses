 " \nMany times they have afflicted me from my youth up. \nLet Israel now say, ",
 "many times they have afflicted me from my youth up, \nyet they have not prevailed against me. ",
 "The plowers plowed on my back. \nThey made their furrows long. ",
 "Yahweh is righteous. \nHe has cut apart the cords of the wicked. ",
 "Let them be disappointed and turned backward, \nall those who hate Zion. ",
 "Let them be as the grass on the housetops, \nwhich withers before it grows up, ",
 "with which the reaper doesn’t fill his hand, \nnor he who binds sheaves, his bosom. ",
 "Neither do those who go by say, \n“The blessing of Yahweh be on you. \nWe bless you in Yahweh’s name.” "
