 " \nCome near, you nations, to hear! \nListen, you peoples. \nLet the earth and all it contains hear, \nthe world, and everything that comes from it. ",
 "For Yahweh is enraged against all the nations, \nand angry with all their armies. \nHe has utterly destroyed them. \nHe has given them over for slaughter. ",
 "Their slain will also be cast out, \nand the stench of their dead bodies will come up. \nThe mountains will melt in their blood. ",
 "All of the army of the sky will be dissolved. \nThe sky will be rolled up like a scroll, \nand all its armies will fade away, \nas a leaf fades from off a vine or a fig tree. ",
 "For my sword has drunk its fill in the sky. \nBehold, it will come down on Edom, \nand on the people of my curse, for judgment. ",
 "Yahweh’s sword is filled with blood. \nIt is covered with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, \nwith the fat of the kidneys of rams; \nfor Yahweh has a sacrifice in Bozrah, \nAnd a great slaughter in the land of Edom. ",
 "The wild oxen will come down with them, \nand the young bulls with the mighty bulls; \nand their land will be drunken with blood, \nand their dust made greasy with fat. \n ",
 "For Yahweh has a day of vengeance, \na year of recompense for the cause of Zion. ",
 "Its streams will be turned into pitch, \nits dust into sulfur, \nAnd its land will become burning pitch. ",
 "It won’t be quenched night nor day. \nIts smoke will go up forever. \nFrom generation to generation, it will lie waste. \nNo one will pass through it forever and ever. ",
 "But the pelican and the porcupine will possess it. \nThe owl and the raven will dwell in it. \nHe will stretch the line of confusion over it, \nand the plumb line of emptiness. ",
 "They shall call its nobles to the kingdom, but none shall be there; \nand all its princes shall be nothing. ",
 "Thorns will come up in its palaces, \nnettles and thistles in its fortresses; \nand it will be a habitation of jackals, \na court for ostriches. ",
 "The wild animals of the desert will meet with the wolves, \nand the wild goat will cry to his fellow. \nYes, the night creature shall settle there, \nand shall find herself a place of rest. ",
 "The arrow snake will make her nest there, \nand lay, hatch, and gather under her shade. \nYes, the kites will be gathered there, every one with her mate. \n ",
 "Search in the book of Yahweh, and read: \nnot one of these will be missing. \nNone will lack her mate. \nFor my mouth has commanded, \nand his Spirit has gathered them. ",
 "He has cast the lot for them, \nand his hand has divided it to them with a measuring line. \nThey shall possess it forever. \nFrom generation to generation they will dwell in it. "
