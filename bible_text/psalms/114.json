 " \nWhen Israel went out of Egypt, \nthe house of Jacob from a people of foreign language, ",
 "Judah became his sanctuary, \nIsrael his dominion. ",
 "The sea saw it, and fled. \nThe Jordan was driven back. ",
 "The mountains skipped like rams, \nthe little hills like lambs. ",
 "What was it, you sea, that you fled? \nYou Jordan, that you turned back? ",
 "You mountains, that you skipped like rams; \nyou little hills, like lambs? ",
 "Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord, \nat the presence of the God of Jacob, ",
 "who turned the rock into a pool of water, \nthe flint into a spring of waters. "
