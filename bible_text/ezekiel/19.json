 "“Moreover, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,  ",
 "and say, \n‘What was your mother? \nA lioness. \nShe couched among lions, \nin the middle of the young lions she nourished her cubs. ",
 "She brought up one of her cubs. \nHe became a young lion. \nHe learned to catch the prey. \nHe devoured men. ",
 "The nations also heard of him. \nHe was taken in their pit; \nand they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt. \n ",
 "“ ‘Now when she saw that she had waited, \nand her hope was lost, \nthen she took another of her cubs, \nand made him a young lion. ",
 "He went up and down among the lions. \nHe became a young lion. \nHe learned to catch the prey. \nHe devoured men. ",
 "He knew their palaces, \nand laid waste their cities. \nThe land was desolate, \nwith its fullness, \nbecause of the noise of his roaring. ",
 "Then the nations attacked him on every side from the provinces. \nThey spread their net over him. \nHe was taken in their pit. ",
 "They put him in a cage with hooks, \nand brought him to the king of Babylon. \nThey brought him into strongholds, \nso that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel. \n ",
 "“ ‘Your mother was like a vine \nin your blood, \nplanted by the waters. \nIt was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters. ",
 "It had strong branches for the scepters of those who ruled. \nTheir stature was exalted among the thick boughs. \nThey were seen in their height \nwith the multitude of their branches. ",
 "But it was plucked up in fury. \nIt was cast down to the ground, \nand the east wind dried up its fruit. \nIts strong branches were broken off and withered. \nThe fire consumed them. ",
 "Now it is planted in the wilderness, \nin a dry and thirsty land. ",
 "Fire has gone out of its branches. \nIt has devoured its fruit, \nso that there is in it no strong branch to be a scepter to rule.’ \nThis is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.” "
