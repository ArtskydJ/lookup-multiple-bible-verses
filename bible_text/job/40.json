 "Moreover Yahweh answered Job, \n ",
 "“Shall he who argues contend with the Almighty? \nHe who argues with God, let him answer it.” ",
 "Then Job answered Yahweh, \n ",
 "“Behold, I am of small account. What will I answer you? \nI lay my hand on my mouth. ",
 "I have spoken once, and I will not answer; \nYes, twice, but I will proceed no further.” ",
 "Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind, \n ",
 "“Now brace yourself like a man. \nI will question you, and you will answer me. ",
 "Will you even annul my judgment? \nWill you condemn me, that you may be justified? ",
 "Or do you have an arm like God? \nCan you thunder with a voice like him? \n ",
 "“Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity. \nArray yourself with honor and majesty. ",
 "Pour out the fury of your anger. \nLook at everyone who is proud, and bring him low. ",
 "Look at everyone who is proud, and humble him. \nCrush the wicked in their place. ",
 "Hide them in the dust together. \nBind their faces in the hidden place. ",
 "Then I will also admit to you \nthat your own right hand can save you. \n ",
 "“See now, behemoth, which I made as well as you. \nHe eats grass as an ox. ",
 "Look now, his strength is in his thighs. \nHis force is in the muscles of his belly. ",
 "He moves his tail like a cedar. \nThe sinews of his thighs are knit together. ",
 "His bones are like tubes of bronze. \nHis limbs are like bars of iron. \n ",
 "He is the chief of the ways of God. \nHe who made him gives him his sword. ",
 "Surely the mountains produce food for him, \nwhere all the animals of the field play. ",
 "He lies under the lotus trees, \nin the covert of the reed, and the marsh. ",
 "The lotuses cover him with their shade. \nThe willows of the brook surround him. ",
 "Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn’t tremble. \nHe is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his mouth. ",
 "Shall any take him when he is on the watch, \nor pierce through his nose with a snare? "
