 "Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, \n ",
 "“How long will you speak these things? \nShall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind? ",
 "Does God pervert justice? \nOr does the Almighty pervert righteousness? ",
 "If your children have sinned against him, \nhe has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience. ",
 "If you want to seek God diligently, \nmake your supplication to the Almighty. ",
 "If you were pure and upright, \nsurely now he would awaken for you, \nand make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous. ",
 "Though your beginning was small, \nyet your latter end would greatly increase. \n ",
 "“Please inquire of past generations. \nFind out about the learning of their fathers. ",
 "(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, \nbecause our days on earth are a shadow.) ",
 "Shall they not teach you, tell you, \nand utter words out of their heart? \n ",
 "“Can the papyrus grow up without mire? \nCan the rushes grow without water? ",
 "While it is yet in its greenness, not cut down, \nit withers before any other reed. ",
 "So are the paths of all who forget God. \nThe hope of the godless man will perish, ",
 "Whose confidence will break apart, \nWhose trust is a spider’s web. ",
 "He will lean on his house, but it will not stand. \nHe will cling to it, but it will not endure. ",
 "He is green before the sun. \nHis shoots go out along his garden. ",
 "His roots are wrapped around the rock pile. \nHe sees the place of stones. ",
 "If he is destroyed from his place, \nthen it will deny him, saying, ‘I have not seen you.’ ",
 "Behold, this is the joy of his way: \nout of the earth, others will spring. \n ",
 "“Behold, God will not cast away a blameless man, \nneither will he uphold the evildoers. ",
 "He will still fill your mouth with laughter, \nyour lips with shouting. ",
 "Those who hate you will be clothed with shame. \nThe tent of the wicked will be no more.” "
