 "Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked, \nnor stand on the path of sinners, \nnor sit in the seat of scoffers; ",
 "but his delight is in Yahweh’s law. \nOn his law he meditates day and night. ",
 "He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water, \nthat produces its fruit in its season, \nwhose leaf also does not wither. \nWhatever he does shall prosper. ",
 "The wicked are not so, \nbut are like the chaff which the wind drives away. ",
 "Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, \nnor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. ",
 "For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, \nbut the way of the wicked shall perish. "
