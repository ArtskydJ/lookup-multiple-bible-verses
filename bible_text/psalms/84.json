 " \nHow lovely are your dwellings, \nYahweh of Armies! ",
 "My soul longs, and even faints for the courts of Yahweh. \nMy heart and my flesh cry out for the living God. ",
 "Yes, the sparrow has found a home, \nand the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young, \nnear your altars, Yahweh of Armies, my King, and my God. ",
 "Blessed are those who dwell in your house. \nThey are always praising you. ",
 "Blessed are those whose strength is in you, \nwho have set their hearts on a pilgrimage. ",
 "Passing through the valley of Weeping, they make it a place of springs. \nYes, the autumn rain covers it with blessings. ",
 "They go from strength to strength. \nEvery one of them appears before God in Zion. ",
 "Yahweh, God of Armies, hear my prayer. \nListen, God of Jacob. ",
 "Behold, God our shield, \nlook at the face of your anointed. ",
 "For a day in your courts is better than a thousand. \nI would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, \nthan to dwell in the tents of wickedness. ",
 "For Yahweh God is a sun and a shield. \nYahweh will give grace and glory. \nHe withholds no good thing from those who walk blamelessly. ",
 "Yahweh of Armies, \nblessed is the man who trusts in you. "
