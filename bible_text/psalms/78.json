 " \nHear my teaching, my people. \nTurn your ears to the words of my mouth. ",
 "I will open my mouth in a parable. \nI will utter dark sayings of old, ",
 "Which we have heard and known, \nand our fathers have told us. ",
 "We will not hide them from their children, \ntelling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh, \nhis strength, and his wondrous deeds that he has done. ",
 "For he established a covenant in Jacob, \nand appointed a teaching in Israel, \nwhich he commanded our fathers, \nthat they should make them known to their children; ",
 "that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born; \nwho should arise and tell their children, ",
 "that they might set their hope in God, \nand not forget God’s deeds, \nbut keep his commandments, ",
 "and might not be as their fathers, \na stubborn and rebellious generation, \na generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal, \nwhose spirit was not steadfast with God. ",
 "The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, \nturned back in the day of battle. ",
 "They didn’t keep God’s covenant, \nand refused to walk in his law. ",
 "They forgot his doings, \nhis wondrous deeds that he had shown them. ",
 "He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, \nin the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. ",
 "He split the sea, and caused them to pass through. \nHe made the waters stand as a heap. ",
 "In the daytime he also led them with a cloud, \nand all night with a light of fire. ",
 "He split rocks in the wilderness, \nand gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths. ",
 "He brought streams also out of the rock, \nand caused waters to run down like rivers. ",
 "Yet they still went on to sin against him, \nto rebel against the Most High in the desert. ",
 "They tempted God in their heart \nby asking food according to their desire. ",
 "Yes, they spoke against God. \nThey said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? ",
 "Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, \nand streams overflowed. \nCan he give bread also? \nWill he provide meat for his people?” ",
 "Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry. \nA fire was kindled against Jacob, \nanger also went up against Israel, ",
 "because they didn’t believe in God, \nand didn’t trust in his salvation. ",
 "Yet he commanded the skies above, \nand opened the doors of heaven. ",
 "He rained down manna on them to eat, \nand gave them food from the sky. ",
 "Man ate the bread of angels. \nHe sent them food to the full. ",
 "He caused the east wind to blow in the sky. \nBy his power he guided the south wind. ",
 "He also rained meat on them as the dust, \nwinged birds as the sand of the seas. ",
 "He let them fall in the middle of their camp, \naround their habitations. ",
 "So they ate, and were well filled. \nHe gave them their own desire. ",
 "They didn’t turn from their cravings. \nTheir food was yet in their mouths, ",
 "when the anger of God went up against them, \nkilled some of their fattest, \nand struck down the young men of Israel. ",
 "For all this they still sinned, \nand didn’t believe in his wondrous works. ",
 "Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, \nand their years in terror. ",
 "When he killed them, then they inquired after him. \nThey returned and sought God earnestly. ",
 "They remembered that God was their rock, \nthe Most High God, their redeemer. ",
 "But they flattered him with their mouth, \nand lied to him with their tongue. ",
 "For their heart was not right with him, \nneither were they faithful in his covenant. ",
 "But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them. \nYes, many times he turned his anger away, \nand didn’t stir up all his wrath. ",
 "He remembered that they were but flesh, \na wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again. ",
 "How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, \nand grieved him in the desert! ",
 "They turned again and tempted God, \nand provoked the Holy One of Israel. ",
 "They didn’t remember his hand, \nnor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary; ",
 "how he set his signs in Egypt, \nhis wonders in the field of Zoan, ",
 "he turned their rivers into blood, \nand their streams, so that they could not drink. ",
 "He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; \nand frogs, which destroyed them. ",
 "He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, \nand their labor to the locust. ",
 "He destroyed their vines with hail, \ntheir sycamore fig trees with frost. ",
 "He gave over their livestock also to the hail, \nand their flocks to hot thunderbolts. ",
 "He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, \nwrath, indignation, and trouble, \nand a band of angels of evil. ",
 "He made a path for his anger. \nHe didn’t spare their soul from death, \nbut gave their life over to the pestilence, ",
 "and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, \nthe chief of their strength in the tents of Ham. ",
 "But he led out his own people like sheep, \nand guided them in the wilderness like a flock. ",
 "He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid, \nbut the sea overwhelmed their enemies. ",
 "He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, \nto this mountain, which his right hand had taken. ",
 "He also drove out the nations before them, \nallotted them for an inheritance by line, \nand made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. ",
 "Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, \nand didn’t keep his testimonies, ",
 "but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. \nThey were twisted like a deceitful bow. ",
 "For they provoked him to anger with their high places, \nand moved him to jealousy with their engraved images. ",
 "When God heard this, he was angry, \nand greatly abhorred Israel, ",
 "so that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh, \nthe tent which he placed among men, ",
 "and delivered his strength into captivity, \nhis glory into the adversary’s hand. ",
 "He also gave his people over to the sword, \nand was angry with his inheritance. ",
 "Fire devoured their young men. \nTheir virgins had no wedding song. ",
 "Their priests fell by the sword, \nand their widows couldn’t weep. ",
 "Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, \nlike a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine. ",
 "He struck his adversaries backward. \nHe put them to a perpetual reproach. ",
 "Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, \nand didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim, ",
 "But chose the tribe of Judah, \nMount Zion which he loved. ",
 "He built his sanctuary like the heights, \nlike the earth which he has established forever. ",
 "He also chose David his servant, \nand took him from the sheepfolds; ",
 "from following the ewes that have their young, \nhe brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, \nand Israel, his inheritance. ",
 "So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, \nand guided them by the skillfulness of his hands. "
