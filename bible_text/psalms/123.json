 " \nI lift up my eyes to you, \nyou who sit in the heavens. ",
 "Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, \nas the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress; \nso our eyes look to Yahweh, our God, \nuntil he has mercy on us. ",
 "Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us, \nfor we have endured much contempt. ",
 "Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease, \nwith the contempt of the proud. "
