 " \nAs the deer pants for the water brooks, \nso my soul pants after you, God. ",
 "My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. \nWhen shall I come and appear before God? ",
 "My tears have been my food day and night, \nwhile they continually ask me, “Where is your God?” ",
 "These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, \nhow I used to go with the crowd, and led them to God’s house, \nwith the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping a holy day. ",
 "Why are you in despair, my soul? \nWhy are you disturbed within me? \nHope in God! \nFor I shall still praise him for the saving help of his presence. ",
 "My God, my soul is in despair within me. \nTherefore I remember you from the land of the Jordan, \nthe heights of Hermon, from the hill Mizar. ",
 "Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls. \nAll your waves and your billows have swept over me. \n ",
 "Yahweh will command his loving kindness in the daytime. \nIn the night his song shall be with me: \na prayer to the God of my life. ",
 "I will ask God, my rock, “Why have you forgotten me? \nWhy do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?” ",
 "As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries reproach me, \nwhile they continually ask me, “Where is your God?” ",
 "Why are you in despair, my soul? \nWhy are you disturbed within me? \nHope in God! For I shall still praise him, \nthe saving help of my countenance, and my God. "
