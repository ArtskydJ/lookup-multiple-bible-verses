 " \nFor Zion’s sake I will not hold my peace, \nand for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, \nuntil her righteousness shines out like the dawn, \nand her salvation like a burning lamp. ",
 "The nations will see your righteousness, \nand all kings your glory. \nYou will be called by a new name, \nwhich Yahweh’s mouth will name. ",
 "You will also be a crown of beauty in Yahweh‘s hand, \nand a royal diadem in your God’s hand. ",
 "You will not be called Forsaken any more, \nnor will your land be called Desolate any more; \nbut you will be called Hephzibah, \nand your land Beulah; \nfor Yahweh delights in you, \nand your land will be married. ",
 "For as a young man marries a virgin, \nso your sons will marry you. \nAs a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, \nso your God will rejoice over you. \n ",
 "I have set watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem. \nThey will never be silent day nor night. \nYou who call on Yahweh, take no rest, ",
 "and give him no rest, until he establishes, \nand until he makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth. \n ",
 "Yahweh has sworn by his right hand, \nand by the arm of his strength, \n“Surely I will no more give your grain to be food for your enemies, \nand foreigners will not drink your new wine, for which you have labored, ",
 "but those who have harvested it will eat it, and praise Yahweh. \nThose who have gathered it will drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.” \n ",
 "Go through, go through the gates! \nPrepare the way of the people! \nBuild up, build up the highway! \nGather out the stones! \nLift up a banner for the peoples. ",
 "Behold, Yahweh has proclaimed to the end of the earth, \n“Say to the daughter of Zion, \n‘Behold, your salvation comes! \nBehold, his reward is with him, \nand his recompense before him!’ ” ",
 "They will call them “The Holy People, \nYahweh’s Redeemed”. \nYou will be called “Sought Out, \nA City Not Forsaken”. "
