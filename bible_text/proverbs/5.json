 " \nMy son, pay attention to my wisdom. \nTurn your ear to my understanding, ",
 "that you may maintain discretion, \nthat your lips may preserve knowledge. ",
 "For the lips of an adulteress drip honey. \nHer mouth is smoother than oil, ",
 "but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, \nand as sharp as a two-edged sword. ",
 "Her feet go down to death. \nHer steps lead straight to Sheol. ",
 "She gives no thought to the way of life. \nHer ways are crooked, and she doesn’t know it. \n ",
 "Now therefore, my sons, listen to me. \nDon’t depart from the words of my mouth. ",
 "Remove your way far from her. \nDon’t come near the door of her house, ",
 "lest you give your honor to others, \nand your years to the cruel one; ",
 "lest strangers feast on your wealth, \nand your labors enrich another man’s house. ",
 "You will groan at your latter end, \nwhen your flesh and your body are consumed, ",
 "and say, “How I have hated instruction, \nand my heart despised reproof; ",
 "neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, \nnor turned my ear to those who instructed me! ",
 "I have come to the brink of utter ruin, \namong the gathered assembly.” \n ",
 "Drink water out of your own cistern, \nrunning water out of your own well. ",
 "Should your springs overflow in the streets, \nstreams of water in the public squares? ",
 "Let them be for yourself alone, \nnot for strangers with you. ",
 "Let your spring be blessed. \nRejoice in the wife of your youth. ",
 "A loving doe and a graceful deer— \nlet her breasts satisfy you at all times. \nBe captivated always with her love. ",
 "For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress? \nWhy embrace the bosom of another? ",
 "For the ways of man are before Yahweh’s eyes. \nHe examines all his paths. ",
 "The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him. \nThe cords of his sin hold him firmly. ",
 "He will die for lack of instruction. \nIn the greatness of his folly, he will go astray. "
