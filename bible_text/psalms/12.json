 " \nHelp, Yahweh; for the godly man ceases. \nFor the faithful fail from among the children of men. ",
 "Everyone lies to his neighbor. \nThey speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart. ",
 "May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips, \nand the tongue that boasts, ",
 "who have said, “With our tongue we will prevail. \nOur lips are our own. \nWho is lord over us?” ",
 "“Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy, \nI will now arise,” says Yahweh; \n“I will set him in safety from those who malign him.” ",

 "You will keep them, Yahweh. \nYou will preserve them from this generation forever. ",
 "The wicked walk on every side, \nwhen what is vile is exalted among the sons of men. "
