 " \nA revelation is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked: \n“There is no fear of God before his eyes.” ",
 "For he flatters himself in his own eyes, \ntoo much to detect and hate his sin. ",
 "The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit. \nHe has ceased to be wise and to do good. ",
 "He plots iniquity on his bed. \nHe sets himself in a way that is not good. \nHe doesn’t abhor evil. \n ",
 "Your loving kindness, Yahweh, is in the heavens. \nYour faithfulness reaches to the skies. ",
 "Your righteousness is like the mountains of God. \nYour judgments are like a great deep. \nYahweh, you preserve man and animal. ",
 "How precious is your loving kindness, God! \nThe children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings. ",
 "They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house. \nYou will make them drink of the river of your pleasures. ",
 "For with you is the spring of life. \nIn your light we will see light. ",
 "Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you, \nyour righteousness to the upright in heart. ",
 "Don’t let the foot of pride come against me. \nDon’t let the hand of the wicked drive me away. ",
 "There the workers of iniquity are fallen. \nThey are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise. "
