 " \nI said, “I will watch my ways, so that I don’t sin with my tongue. \nI will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me.” ",
 "I was mute with silence. \nI held my peace, even from good. \nMy sorrow was stirred. ",
 "My heart was hot within me. \nWhile I meditated, the fire burned. \nI spoke with my tongue: ",
 "“Yahweh, show me my end, \nwhat is the measure of my days. \nLet me know how frail I am. ",
 "Behold, you have made my days hand widths. \nMy lifetime is as nothing before you. \nSurely every man stands as a breath.” ",
 "“Surely every man walks like a shadow. \nSurely they busy themselves in vain. \nHe heaps up, and doesn’t know who shall gather. ",
 "Now, Lord, what do I wait for? \nMy hope is in you. ",
 "Deliver me from all my transgressions. \nDon’t make me the reproach of the foolish. ",
 "I was mute. \nI didn’t open my mouth, \nbecause you did it. ",
 "Remove your scourge away from me. \nI am overcome by the blow of your hand. ",
 "When you rebuke and correct man for iniquity, \nyou consume his wealth like a moth. \nSurely every man is but a breath.” ",
 "“Hear my prayer, Yahweh, and give ear to my cry. \nDon’t be silent at my tears. \nFor I am a stranger with you, \na foreigner, as all my fathers were. ",
 "Oh spare me, that I may recover strength, \nbefore I go away and exist no more.” "
