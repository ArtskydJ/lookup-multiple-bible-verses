 " \nBe merciful to me, God, be merciful to me, \nfor my soul takes refuge in you. \nYes, in the shadow of your wings, I will take refuge, \nuntil disaster has passed. ",
 "I cry out to God Most High, \nto God who accomplishes my requests for me. ",
 "He will send from heaven, and save me, \nhe rebukes the one who is pursuing me. \nGod will send out his loving kindness and his truth. ",
 "My soul is among lions. \nI lie among those who are set on fire, \neven the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, \nand their tongue a sharp sword. ",
 "Be exalted, God, above the heavens! \nLet your glory be above all the earth! \n ",
 "They have prepared a net for my steps. \nMy soul is bowed down. \nThey dig a pit before me. \nThey fall into the middle of it themselves. ",
 "My heart is steadfast, God. \nMy heart is steadfast. \nI will sing, yes, I will sing praises. ",
 "Wake up, my glory! Wake up, lute and harp! \nI will wake up the dawn. ",
 "I will give thanks to you, Lord, among the peoples. \nI will sing praises to you among the nations. ",
 "For your great loving kindness reaches to the heavens, \nand your truth to the skies. ",
 "Be exalted, God, above the heavens. \nLet your glory be over all the earth. "
