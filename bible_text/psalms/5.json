 " \nGive ear to my words, Yahweh. \nConsider my meditation. ",
 "Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God; \nfor I pray to you. ",
 "Yahweh, in the morning you will hear my voice. \nIn the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly. ",
 "For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness. \nEvil canâ€™t live with you. ",
 "The arrogant will not stand in your sight. \nYou hate all workers of iniquity. ",
 "You will destroy those who speak lies. \nYahweh abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. ",
 "But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house. \nI will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you. ",
 "Lead me, Yahweh, in your righteousness because of my enemies. \nMake your way straight before my face. ",
 "For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. \nTheir heart is destruction. \nTheir throat is an open tomb. \nThey flatter with their tongue. ",
 "Hold them guilty, God. \nLet them fall by their own counsels. \nThrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions, \nfor they have rebelled against you. ",
 "But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice. \nLet them always shout for joy, because you defend them. \nLet them also who love your name be joyful in you. ",
 "For you will bless the righteous. \nYahweh, you will surround him with favor as with a shield. "
