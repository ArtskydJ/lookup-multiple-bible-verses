 " \nIf it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, \nlet Israel now say, ",
 "if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, \nwhen men rose up against us; ",
 "then they would have swallowed us up alive, \nwhen their wrath was kindled against us; ",
 "then the waters would have overwhelmed us, \nthe stream would have gone over our soul; ",
 "then the proud waters would have gone over our soul. ",
 "Blessed be Yahweh, \nwho has not given us as a prey to their teeth. ",
 "Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler’s snare. \nThe snare is broken, and we have escaped. ",
 "Our help is in Yahweh’s name, \nwho made heaven and earth. "
