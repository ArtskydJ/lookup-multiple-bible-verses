 " \nVindicate me, God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation. \nOh, deliver me from deceitful and wicked men. ",
 "For you are the God of my strength. Why have you rejected me? \nWhy do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? ",
 "Oh, send out your light and your truth. \nLet them lead me. \nLet them bring me to your holy hill, \nto your tents. ",
 "Then I will go to the altar of God, \nto God, my exceeding joy. \nI will praise you on the harp, God, my God. ",
 "Why are you in despair, my soul? \nWhy are you disturbed within me? \nHope in God! \nFor I shall still praise him: \nmy Savior, my helper, and my God. "
