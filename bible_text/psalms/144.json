 " \nBlessed be Yahweh, my rock, \nwho teaches my hands to war, \nand my fingers to battle: ",
 "my loving kindness, my fortress, \nmy high tower, my deliverer, \nmy shield, and he in whom I take refuge, \nwho subdues my people under me. ",
 "Yahweh, what is man, that you care for him? \nOr the son of man, that you think of him? ",
 "Man is like a breath. \nHis days are like a shadow that passes away. ",
 "Part your heavens, Yahweh, and come down. \nTouch the mountains, and they will smoke. ",
 "Throw out lightning, and scatter them. \nSend out your arrows, and rout them. ",
 "Stretch out your hand from above, \nrescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, \nout of the hands of foreigners, ",
 "whose mouths speak deceit, \nwhose right hand is a right hand of falsehood. ",
 "I will sing a new song to you, God. \nOn a ten-stringed lyre, I will sing praises to you. ",
 "You are he who gives salvation to kings, \nwho rescues David, his servant, from the deadly sword. ",
 "Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners, \nwhose mouths speak deceit, \nwhose right hand is a right hand of falsehood. \n ",
 "Then our sons will be like well-nurtured plants, \nour daughters like pillars carved to adorn a palace. ",
 "Our barns are full, filled with all kinds of provision. \nOur sheep produce thousands and ten thousands in our fields. ",
 "Our oxen will pull heavy loads. \nThere is no breaking in, and no going away, \nand no outcry in our streets. ",
 "Happy are the people who are in such a situation. \nHappy are the people whose God is Yahweh. "
