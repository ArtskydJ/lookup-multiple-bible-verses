 " \nBehold, a king shall reign in righteousness, \nand princes shall rule in justice. ",
 "A man shall be as a hiding place from the wind, \nand a covert from the storm, \nas streams of water in a dry place, \nas the shade of a large rock in a weary land. ",
 "The eyes of those who see will not be dim, \nand the ears of those who hear will listen. ",
 "The heart of the rash will understand knowledge, \nand the tongue of the stammerers will be ready to speak plainly. ",
 "The fool will no longer be called noble, \nnor the scoundrel be highly respected. ",
 "For the fool will speak folly, \nand his heart will work iniquity, \nto practice profanity, \nand to utter error against Yahweh, \nto make empty the soul of the hungry, \nand to cause the drink of the thirsty to fail. ",
 "The ways of the scoundrel are evil. \nHe devises wicked plans to destroy the humble with lying words, \neven when the needy speaks right. ",
 "But the noble devises noble things; \nand he will continue in noble things. \n ",
 "Rise up, you women who are at ease! Hear my voice! \nYou careless daughters, give ear to my speech! ",
 "For days beyond a year you will be troubled, you careless women; \nfor the vintage will fail. \nThe harvest won’t come. ",
 "Tremble, you women who are at ease! \nBe troubled, you careless ones! \nStrip yourselves, make yourselves naked, \nand put sackcloth on your waist. ",
 "Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, \nfor the fruitful vine. ",
 "Thorns and briers will come up on my people’s land; \nyes, on all the houses of joy in the joyous city. ",
 "For the palace will be forsaken. \nThe populous city will be deserted. \nThe hill and the watchtower will be for dens forever, \na delight for wild donkeys, \na pasture of flocks, ",
 "until the Spirit is poured on us from on high, \nand the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, \nand the fruitful field is considered a forest. \n ",
 "Then justice will dwell in the wilderness; \nand righteousness will remain in the fruitful field. ",
 "The work of righteousness will be peace, \nand the effect of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever. ",
 "My people will live in a peaceful habitation, \nin safe dwellings, \nand in quiet resting places, ",
 "though hail flattens the forest, \nand the city is leveled completely. ",
 "Blessed are you who sow beside all waters, \nwho send out the feet of the ox and the donkey. "
