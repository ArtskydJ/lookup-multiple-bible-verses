 " \nGive ear, you heavens, and I will speak. \nLet the earth hear the words of my mouth. ",
 "My doctrine will drop as the rain. \nMy speech will condense as the dew, \nas the misty rain on the tender grass, \nas the showers on the herb. ",
 "For I will proclaim Yahweh’s name. \nAscribe greatness to our God! ",
 "The Rock: his work is perfect, \nfor all his ways are just. \nA God of faithfulness who does no wrong, \njust and right is he. ",
 "They have dealt corruptly with him. \nThey are not his children, because of their defect. \nThey are a perverse and crooked generation. ",
 "Is this the way you repay Yahweh, \nfoolish and unwise people? \nIsn’t he your father who has bought you? \nHe has made you and established you. ",
 "Remember the days of old. \nConsider the years of many generations. \nAsk your father, and he will show you; \nyour elders, and they will tell you. ",
 "When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, \nwhen he separated the children of men, \nhe set the bounds of the peoples \naccording to the number of the children of Israel. ",
 "For Yahweh’s portion is his people. \nJacob is the lot of his inheritance. ",
 "He found him in a desert land, \nin the waste howling wilderness. \nHe surrounded him. \nHe cared for him. \nHe kept him as the apple of his eye. ",
 "As an eagle that stirs up her nest, \nthat flutters over her young, \nhe spread abroad his wings, \nhe took them, \nhe bore them on his feathers. ",
 "Yahweh alone led him. \nThere was no foreign god with him. ",
 "He made him ride on the high places of the earth. \nHe ate the increase of the field. \nHe caused him to suck honey out of the rock, \noil out of the flinty rock; ",
 "butter from the herd, and milk from the flock, \nwith fat of lambs, \nrams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, \nwith the finest of the wheat. \nFrom the blood of the grape, you drank wine. ",
 "But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked. \nYou have grown fat. \nYou have grown thick. \nYou have become sleek. \nThen he abandoned God who made him, \nand rejected the Rock of his salvation. ",
 "They moved him to jealousy with strange gods. \nThey provoked him to anger with abominations. ",
 "They sacrificed to demons, not God, \nto gods that they didn’t know, \nto new gods that came up recently, \nwhich your fathers didn’t dread. ",
 "Of the Rock who became your father, you are unmindful, \nand have forgotten God who gave you birth. ",
 "Yahweh saw and abhorred, \nbecause of the provocation of his sons and his daughters. ",
 "He said, “I will hide my face from them. \nI will see what their end will be; \nfor they are a very perverse generation, \nchildren in whom is no faithfulness. ",
 "They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God. \nThey have provoked me to anger with their vanities. \nI will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people. \nI will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation. ",
 "For a fire is kindled in my anger, \nthat burns to the lowest Sheol, \ndevours the earth with its increase, \nand sets the foundations of the mountains on fire. \n ",
 "“I will heap evils on them. \nI will spend my arrows on them. ",
 "They shall be wasted with hunger, \nand devoured with burning heat \nand bitter destruction. \nI will send the teeth of animals on them, \nwith the venom of vipers that glide in the dust. ",
 "Outside the sword will bereave, \nand in the rooms, \nterror on both young man and virgin, \nthe nursing infant with the gray-haired man. ",
 "I said that I would scatter them afar. \nI would make their memory to cease from among men; ",
 "were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, \nlest their adversaries should judge wrongly, \nlest they should say, ‘Our hand is exalted, \nYahweh has not done all this.’ ” \n ",
 "For they are a nation void of counsel. \nThere is no understanding in them. ",
 "Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, \nthat they would consider their latter end! ",
 "How could one chase a thousand, \nand two put ten thousand to flight, \nunless their Rock had sold them, \nand Yahweh had delivered them up? ",
 "For their rock is not as our Rock, \neven our enemies themselves concede. ",
 "For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, \nof the fields of Gomorrah. \nTheir grapes are poison grapes. \nTheir clusters are bitter. ",
 "Their wine is the poison of serpents, \nthe cruel venom of asps. \n ",
 "“Isn’t this laid up in store with me, \nsealed up among my treasures? ",
 "Vengeance is mine, and recompense, \nat the time when their foot slides; \nfor the day of their calamity is at hand. \nTheir doom rushes at them.” \n ",
 "For Yahweh will judge his people, \nand have compassion on his servants, \nwhen he sees that their power is gone; \nthat there is no one remaining, shut up or left at large. ",
 "He will say, “Where are their gods, \nthe rock in which they took refuge; ",
 "which ate the fat of their sacrifices, \nand drank the wine of their drink offering? \nLet them rise up and help you! \nLet them be your protection. \n ",
 "“See now that I myself am he. \nThere is no god with me. \nI kill and I make alive. \nI wound and I heal. \nThere is no one who can deliver out of my hand. ",
 "For I lift up my hand to heaven and declare, \nas I live forever, ",
 "if I sharpen my glittering sword, \nmy hand grasps it in judgment; \nI will take vengeance on my adversaries, \nand will repay those who hate me. ",
 "I will make my arrows drunk with blood. \nMy sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives, \nfrom the head of the leaders of the enemy.” \n ",
 "Rejoice, you nations, with his people, \nfor he will avenge the blood of his servants. \nHe will take vengeance on his adversaries, \nand will make atonement for his land and for his people. ",
 "Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.  ",
 "Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel.  ",
 "He said to them, “Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you today, which you shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.  ",
 "For it is no vain thing for you, because it is your life, and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over the Jordan to possess it.” ",
 "Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day, saying,  ",
 "“Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is across from Jericho; and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel for a possession.  ",
 "Die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor, and was gathered to his people;  ",
 "because you trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you didn’t uphold my holiness among the children of Israel.  ",
 "For you shall see the land from a distance; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel.” "
