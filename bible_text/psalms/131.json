 " \nYahweh, my heart isnâ€™t arrogant, nor my eyes lofty; \nnor do I concern myself with great matters, \nor things too wonderful for me. ",
 "Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul, \nlike a weaned child with his mother, \nlike a weaned child is my soul within me. ",
 "Israel, hope in Yahweh, \nfrom this time forward and forever more. "
