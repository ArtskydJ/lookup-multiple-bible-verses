 " \nWhy do the nations rage, \nand the peoples plot a vain thing? ",
 "The kings of the earth take a stand, \nand the rulers take counsel together, \nagainst Yahweh, and against his Anointed, saying, ",
 "“Let’s break their bonds apart, \nand cast their cords from us.” ",
 "He who sits in the heavens will laugh. \nThe Lord will have them in derision. ",
 "Then he will speak to them in his anger, \nand terrify them in his wrath: ",
 "“Yet I have set my King on my holy hill of Zion.” ",
 "I will tell of the decree: \nYahweh said to me, “You are my son. \nToday I have become your father. ",
 "Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance, \nthe uttermost parts of the earth for your possession. ",
 "You shall break them with a rod of iron. \nYou shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” ",
 "Now therefore be wise, you kings. \nBe instructed, you judges of the earth. ",
 "Serve Yahweh with fear, \nand rejoice with trembling. ",
 "Give sincere homage to the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish on the way, \nfor his wrath will soon be kindled. \nBlessed are all those who take refuge in him. "
