 "Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, \n ",
 "“If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved? \nBut who can withhold himself from speaking? ",
 "Behold, you have instructed many, \nyou have strengthened the weak hands. ",
 "Your words have supported him who was falling, \nYou have made firm the feeble knees. ",
 "But now it has come to you, and you faint. \nIt touches you, and you are troubled. ",
 "Isn’t your piety your confidence? \nIsn’t the integrity of your ways your hope? \n ",
 "“Remember, now, whoever perished, being innocent? \nOr where were the upright cut off? ",
 "According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity, \nand sow trouble, \nreap the same. ",
 "By the breath of God they perish. \nBy the blast of his anger are they consumed. ",
 "The roaring of the lion, \nand the voice of the fierce lion, \nthe teeth of the young lions, are broken. ",
 "The old lion perishes for lack of prey. \nThe cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad. \n ",
 "“Now a thing was secretly brought to me. \nMy ear received a whisper of it. ",
 "In thoughts from the visions of the night, \nwhen deep sleep falls on men, ",
 "fear came on me, and trembling, \nwhich made all my bones shake. ",
 "Then a spirit passed before my face. \nThe hair of my flesh stood up. ",
 "It stood still, but I couldn’t discern its appearance. \nA form was before my eyes. \nSilence, then I heard a voice, saying, ",
 "‘Shall mortal man be more just than God? \nShall a man be more pure than his Maker? ",
 "Behold, he puts no trust in his servants. \nHe charges his angels with error. ",
 "How much more, those who dwell in houses of clay, \nwhose foundation is in the dust, \nwho are crushed before the moth! ",
 "Between morning and evening they are destroyed. \nThey perish forever without any regarding it. ",
 "Isn’t their tent cord plucked up within them? \nThey die, and that without wisdom.’ "
