 " \nDo you indeed speak righteousness, silent ones? \nDo you judge blamelessly, you sons of men? ",
 "No, in your heart you plot injustice. \nYou measure out the violence of your hands in the earth. ",
 "The wicked go astray from the womb. \nThey are wayward as soon as they are born, speaking lies. ",
 "Their poison is like the poison of a snake, \nlike a deaf cobra that stops its ear, ",
 "which doesn’t listen to the voice of charmers, \nno matter how skillful the charmer may be. ",
 "Break their teeth, God, in their mouth. \nBreak out the great teeth of the young lions, Yahweh. ",
 "Let them vanish like water that flows away. \nWhen they draw the bow, let their arrows be made blunt. ",
 "Let them be like a snail which melts and passes away, \nlike the stillborn child, who has not seen the sun. ",
 "Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns, \nhe will sweep away the green and the burning alike. ",
 "The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance. \nHe shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked, ",
 "so that men shall say, “Most certainly there is a reward for the righteous. \nMost certainly there is a God who judges the earth.” "
