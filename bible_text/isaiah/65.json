 " \n“I am inquired of by those who didn’t ask. \nI am found by those who didn’t seek me. \nI said, ‘See me, see me,’ to a nation that was not called by my name. ",
 "I have spread out my hands all day to a rebellious people, \nwho walk in a way that is not good, \nafter their own thoughts; ",
 "a people who provoke me to my face continually, \nsacrificing in gardens, \nand burning incense on bricks; ",
 "who sit among the graves, \nand spend nights in secret places; \nwho eat pig’s meat, \nand broth of abominable things is in their vessels; ",
 "who say, ‘Stay by yourself, \ndon’t come near to me, \nfor I am holier than you.’ \nThese are smoke in my nose, \na fire that burns all day. \n ",
 "“Behold, it is written before me: \nI will not keep silence, \nbut will repay, \nyes, I will repay into their bosom, ",
 "your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together”, says Yahweh, \n“who have burned incense on the mountains, \nand blasphemed me on the hills. \nTherefore I will first measure their work into their bosom.” ",
 "Yahweh says, \n“As the new wine is found in the cluster, \nand one says, ‘Don’t destroy it, for a blessing is in it:’ \nso I will do for my servants’ sake, \nthat I may not destroy them all. ",
 "I will bring offspring out of Jacob, \nand out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains. \nMy chosen will inherit it, \nand my servants will dwell there. ",
 "Sharon will be a fold of flocks, \nand the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, \nfor my people who have sought me. \n ",
 "“But you who forsake Yahweh, \nwho forget my holy mountain, \nwho prepare a table for Fortune, \nand who fill up mixed wine to Destiny; ",
 "I will destine you to the sword, \nand you will all bow down to the slaughter; \nbecause when I called, you didn’t answer. \nWhen I spoke, you didn’t listen; \nbut you did that which was evil in my eyes, \nand chose that in which I didn’t delight.” ",
 "Therefore the Lord Yahweh says, \n“Behold, my servants will eat, \nbut you will be hungry; \nbehold, my servants will drink, \nbut you will be thirsty. \nBehold, my servants will rejoice, \nbut you will be disappointed; ",
 "Behold, my servants will sing for joy of heart, \nbut you will cry for sorrow of heart, \nand will wail for anguish of spirit. ",
 "You will leave your name for a curse to my chosen; \nand the Lord Yahweh will kill you. \nHe will call his servants by another name, ",
 "so that he who blesses himself in the earth will bless himself in the God of truth; \nand he who swears in the earth will swear by the God of truth; \nbecause the former troubles are forgotten, \nand because they are hidden from my eyes. \n ",
 "“For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; \nand the former things will not be remembered, \nnor come into mind. ",
 "But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; \nfor, behold, I create Jerusalem to be a delight, \nand her people a joy. ",
 "I will rejoice in Jerusalem, \nand delight in my people; \nand the voice of weeping and the voice of crying \nwill be heard in her no more. \n ",
 "“No more will there be an infant who only lives a few days, \nnor an old man who has not filled his days; \nfor the child will die one hundred years old, \nand the sinner being one hundred years old will be accursed. ",
 "They will build houses and inhabit them. \nThey will plant vineyards and eat their fruit. ",
 "They will not build and another inhabit. \nThey will not plant and another eat: \nfor the days of my people will be like the days of a tree, \nand my chosen will long enjoy the work of their hands. ",
 "They will not labor in vain \nnor give birth for calamity; \nfor they are the offspring of Yahweh’s blessed \nand their descendants with them. ",
 "It will happen that before they call, I will answer; \nand while they are yet speaking, I will hear. ",
 "The wolf and the lamb will feed together. \nThe lion will eat straw like the ox. \nDust will be the serpent’s food. \nThey will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,” \nsays Yahweh. "
