 " \nHear my voice, God, in my complaint. \nPreserve my life from fear of the enemy. ",
 "Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, \nfrom the noisy crowd of the ones doing evil; ",
 "who sharpen their tongue like a sword, \nand aim their arrows, deadly words, ",
 "to shoot innocent men from ambushes. \nThey shoot at him suddenly and fearlessly. ",
 "They encourage themselves in evil plans. \nThey talk about laying snares secretly. \nThey say, “Who will see them?” ",
 "They plot injustice, saying, “We have made a perfect plan!” \nSurely man’s mind and heart are cunning. ",
 "But God will shoot at them. \nThey will be suddenly struck down with an arrow. ",
 "Their own tongues shall ruin them. \nAll who see them will shake their heads. ",
 "All mankind shall be afraid. \nThey shall declare the work of God, \nand shall wisely ponder what he has done. ",
 "The righteous shall be glad in Yahweh, \nand shall take refuge in him. \nAll the upright in heart shall praise him! "
