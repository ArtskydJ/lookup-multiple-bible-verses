 " \nWhen you sit to eat with a ruler, \nconsider diligently what is before you; ",
 "put a knife to your throat, \nif you are a man given to appetite. ",
 "Don’t be desirous of his dainties, \nsince they are deceitful food. ",
 "Don’t weary yourself to be rich. \nIn your wisdom, show restraint. ",
 "Why do you set your eyes on that which is not? \nFor it certainly sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky. ",
 "Don’t eat the food of him who has a stingy eye, \nand don’t crave his delicacies: ",
 "for as he thinks about the cost, so he is. \n“Eat and drink!” he says to you, \nbut his heart is not with you. ",
 "The morsel which you have eaten you shall vomit up, \nand lose your good words. \n ",
 "Don’t speak in the ears of a fool, \nfor he will despise the wisdom of your words. \n ",
 "Don’t move the ancient boundary stone. \nDon’t encroach on the fields of the fatherless, ",
 "for their Defender is strong. \nHe will plead their case against you. \n ",
 "Apply your heart to instruction, \nand your ears to the words of knowledge. ",
 "Don’t withhold correction from a child. \nIf you punish him with the rod, he will not die. ",
 "Punish him with the rod, \nand save his soul from Sheol. \n ",
 "My son, if your heart is wise, \nthen my heart will be glad, even mine. ",

 "for the drunkard and the glutton shall become poor; \nand drowsiness clothes them in rags. ",
 "Listen to your father who gave you life, \nand don’t despise your mother when she is old. ",
 "Buy the truth, and don’t sell it. \nGet wisdom, discipline, and understanding. ",
 "The father of the righteous has great joy. \nWhoever fathers a wise child delights in him. ",
 "Let your father and your mother be glad! \nLet her who bore you rejoice! ",
 "My son, give me your heart; \nand let your eyes keep in my ways. ",
 "For a prostitute is a deep pit; \nand a wayward wife is a narrow well. ",
 "Yes, she lies in wait like a robber, \nand increases the unfaithful among men. \n ",
 "Who has woe? \nWho has sorrow? \nWho has strife? \nWho has complaints? \nWho has needless bruises? \nWho has bloodshot eyes? ",
 "Those who stay long at the wine; \nthose who go to seek out mixed wine. ",
 "Don’t look at the wine when it is red, \nwhen it sparkles in the cup, \nwhen it goes down smoothly. ",
 "In the end, it bites like a snake, \nand poisons like a viper. ",
 "Your eyes will see strange things, \nand your mind will imagine confusing things. ",
 "Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the middle of the sea, \nor as he who lies on top of the rigging: ",
 "“They hit me, and I was not hurt! \nThey beat me, and I don’t feel it! \nWhen will I wake up? I can do it again. \nI can find another.” "
