 " \nUnless Yahweh builds the house, \nthey who build it labor in vain. \nUnless Yahweh watches over the city, \nthe watchman guards it in vain. ",
 "It is vain for you to rise up early, \nto stay up late, \neating the bread of toil, \nfor he gives sleep to his loved ones. ",
 "Behold, children are a heritage of Yahweh. \nThe fruit of the womb is his reward. ",
 "As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, \nso are the children of youth. ",
 "Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them. \nThey wonâ€™t be disappointed when they speak with their enemies in the gate. "
