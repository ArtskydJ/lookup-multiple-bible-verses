 " \nWoe to those who go down to Egypt for help, \nand rely on horses, \nand trust in chariots because they are many, \nand in horsemen because they are very strong, \nbut they don’t look to the Holy One of Israel, \nand they don’t seek Yahweh! ",
 "Yet he also is wise, and will bring disaster, \nand will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evildoers, \nand against the help of those who work iniquity. ",
 "Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; \nand their horses flesh, and not spirit. \nWhen Yahweh stretches out his hand, both he who helps shall stumble, \nand he who is helped shall fall, \nand they all shall be consumed together. \n ",
 "For Yahweh says to me, \n“As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey, \nif a multitude of shepherds is called together against him, \nwill not be dismayed at their voice, \nnor abase himself for their noise, \nso Yahweh of Armies will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its heights. ",
 "As birds hovering, so Yahweh of Armies will protect Jerusalem. \nHe will protect and deliver it. \nHe will pass over and preserve it.” ",
 "Return to him from whom you have deeply revolted, children of Israel.  ",
 "For in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold—sin which your own hands have made for you. ",
 "“The Assyrian will fall by the sword, not of man; \nand the sword, not of mankind, shall devour him. \nHe will flee from the sword, \nand his young men will become subject to forced labor. ",
 "His rock will pass away by reason of terror, \nand his princes will be afraid of the banner,” \nsays Yahweh, whose fire is in Zion, \nand his furnace in Jerusalem. "
