 " \nHear my prayer, Yahweh. \nListen to my petitions. \nIn your faithfulness and righteousness, relieve me. ",
 "Don’t enter into judgment with your servant, \nfor in your sight no man living is righteous. ",

 "I spread out my hands to you. \nMy soul thirsts for you, like a parched land. ",
 "Hurry to answer me, Yahweh. \nMy spirit fails. \nDon’t hide your face from me, \nso that I don’t become like those who go down into the pit. ",
 "Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning, \nfor I trust in you. \nCause me to know the way in which I should walk, \nfor I lift up my soul to you. ",
 "Deliver me, Yahweh, from my enemies. \nI flee to you to hide me. ",
 "Teach me to do your will, \nfor you are my God. \nYour Spirit is good. \nLead me in the land of uprightness. ",
 "Revive me, Yahweh, for your name’s sake. \nIn your righteousness, bring my soul out of trouble. ",
 "In your loving kindness, cut off my enemies, \nand destroy all those who afflict my soul, \nFor I am your servant. "
