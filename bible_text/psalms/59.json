 " \nDeliver me from my enemies, my God. \nSet me on high from those who rise up against me. ",
 "Deliver me from the workers of iniquity. \nSave me from the bloodthirsty men. ",
 "For, behold, they lie in wait for my soul. \nThe mighty gather themselves together against me, \nnot for my disobedience, nor for my sin, Yahweh. ",
 "I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me. \nRise up, behold, and help me! ",
 "You, Yahweh God of Armies, the God of Israel, \nrouse yourself to punish the nations. \nShow no mercy to the wicked traitors. ",
 "They return at evening, howling like dogs, \nand prowl around the city. ",
 "Behold, they spew with their mouth. \nSwords are in their lips, \n“For”, they say, “who hears us?” ",
 "But you, Yahweh, laugh at them. \nYou scoff at all the nations. ",
 "Oh, my Strength, I watch for you, \nfor God is my high tower. ",
 "My God will go before me with his loving kindness. \nGod will let me look at my enemies in triumph. ",
 "Don’t kill them, or my people may forget. \nScatter them by your power, and bring them down, Lord our shield. ",
 "For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips, \nlet them be caught in their pride, \nfor the curses and lies which they utter. ",
 "Consume them in wrath. \nConsume them, and they will be no more. \nLet them know that God rules in Jacob, \nto the ends of the earth. ",
 "At evening let them return. \nLet them howl like a dog, and go around the city. ",
 "They shall wander up and down for food, \nand wait all night if they aren’t satisfied. \n ",
 "But I will sing of your strength. \nYes, I will sing aloud of your loving kindness in the morning. \nFor you have been my high tower, \na refuge in the day of my distress. ",
 "To you, my strength, I will sing praises. \nFor God is my high tower, the God of my mercy. "
