 "Then Job answered, \n ",
 "“How have you helped him who is without power! \nHow have you saved the arm that has no strength! ",
 "How have you counseled him who has no wisdom, \nand plentifully declared sound knowledge! ",
 "To whom have you uttered words? \nWhose spirit came out of you? \n ",
 "“The departed spirits tremble, \nthose beneath the waters and all that live in them. ",
 "Sheol is naked before God, \nand Abaddon has no covering. ",
 "He stretches out the north over empty space, \nand hangs the earth on nothing. ",
 "He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, \nand the cloud is not burst under them. ",
 "He encloses the face of his throne, \nand spreads his cloud on it. ",
 "He has described a boundary on the surface of the waters, \nand to the confines of light and darkness. ",
 "The pillars of heaven tremble \nand are astonished at his rebuke. ",
 "He stirs up the sea with his power, \nand by his understanding he strikes through Rahab. ",
 "By his Spirit the heavens are garnished. \nHis hand has pierced the swift serpent. ",
 "Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways. \nHow small a whisper do we hear of him! \nBut the thunder of his power who can understand?” "
