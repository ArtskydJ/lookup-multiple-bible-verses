 "Who may ascend to Yahweh’s hill? \nWho may stand in his holy place? ",
 "He who has clean hands and a pure heart; \nwho has not lifted up his soul to falsehood, \nand has not sworn deceitfully. ",
 "He shall receive a blessing from Yahweh, \nrighteousness from the God of his salvation. ",
 "This is the generation of those who seek Him, \nwho seek your face—even Jacob. \n ",
 "Lift up your heads, you gates! \nBe lifted up, you everlasting doors, \nand the King of glory will come in. ",
 "Who is the King of glory? \nYahweh strong and mighty, \nYahweh mighty in battle. ",
 "Lift up your heads, you gates; \nyes, lift them up, you everlasting doors, \nand the King of glory will come in. ",
 "Who is this King of glory? \nYahweh of Armies is the King of glory! "
