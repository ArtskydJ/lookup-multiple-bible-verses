 " \nWhere has your beloved gone, you fairest among women? \nWhere has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you? ",
 "My beloved has gone down to his garden, \nto the beds of spices, \nto pasture his flock in the gardens, and to gather lilies. ",
 "I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine. \nHe browses among the lilies. \n ",
 "You are beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, \nlovely as Jerusalem, \nawesome as an army with banners. ",
 "Turn away your eyes from me, \nfor they have overcome me. \nYour hair is like a flock of goats, \nthat lie along the side of Gilead. ",
 "Your teeth are like a flock of ewes, \nwhich have come up from the washing, \nof which every one has twins; \nnot one is bereaved among them. ",
 "Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil. \n ",
 "There are sixty queens, eighty concubines, \nand virgins without number. ",
 "My dove, my perfect one, is unique. \nShe is her mother’s only daughter. \nShe is the favorite one of her who bore her. \nThe daughters saw her, and called her blessed. \nThe queens and the concubines saw her, and they praised her. \n ",
 "Who is she who looks out as the morning, \nbeautiful as the moon, \nclear as the sun, \nand awesome as an army with banners? \n ",
 "I went down into the nut tree grove, \nto see the green plants of the valley, \nto see whether the vine budded, \nand the pomegranates were in flower. ",
 "Without realizing it, \nmy desire set me with my royal people’s chariots. ",
 "Return, return, Shulammite! \nReturn, return, that we may gaze at you. \nWhy do you desire to gaze at the Shulammite, \nas at the dance of Mahanaim? "
