 " \nYahweh, the God of my salvation, \nI have cried day and night before you. ",
 "Let my prayer enter into your presence. \nTurn your ear to my cry. ",
 "For my soul is full of troubles. \nMy life draws near to Sheol. ",
 "I am counted among those who go down into the pit. \nI am like a man who has no help, ",
 "set apart among the dead, \nlike the slain who lie in the grave, \nwhom you remember no more. \nThey are cut off from your hand. ",
 "You have laid me in the lowest pit, \nin the darkest depths. ",
 "Your wrath lies heavily on me. \nYou have afflicted me with all your waves. ",
 "You have taken my friends from me. \nYou have made me an abomination to them. \nI am confined, and I canâ€™t escape. ",
 "My eyes are dim from grief. \nI have called on you daily, Yahweh. \nI have spread out my hands to you. ",
 "Do you show wonders to the dead? \nDo the departed spirits rise up and praise you? ",
 "Is your loving kindness declared in the grave? \nOr your faithfulness in Destruction? ",
 "Are your wonders made known in the dark? \nOr your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? ",
 "But to you, Yahweh, I have cried. \nIn the morning, my prayer comes before you. ",
 "Yahweh, why do you reject my soul? \nWhy do you hide your face from me? ",
 "I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up. \nWhile I suffer your terrors, I am distracted. ",
 "Your fierce wrath has gone over me. \nYour terrors have cut me off. ",
 "They came around me like water all day long. \nThey completely engulfed me. ",
 "You have put lover and friend far from me, \nand my friends into darkness. "
