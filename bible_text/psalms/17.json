 " \nHear, Yahweh, my righteous plea; \nGive ear to my prayer, that doesnâ€™t go out of deceitful lips. ",
 "Let my sentence come out of your presence. \nLet your eyes look on equity. ",
 "You have proved my heart. \nYou have visited me in the night. \nYou have tried me, and found nothing. \nI have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey. ",
 "As for the deeds of men, by the word of your lips, \nI have kept myself from the ways of the violent. ",
 "My steps have held fast to your paths. \nMy feet have not slipped. ",
 "I have called on you, for you will answer me, God. \nTurn your ear to me. \nHear my speech. ",
 "Show your marvelous loving kindness, \nyou who save those who take refuge by your right hand from their enemies. ",
 "Keep me as the apple of your eye. \nHide me under the shadow of your wings, ",
 "from the wicked who oppress me, \nmy deadly enemies, who surround me. ",
 "They close up their callous hearts. \nWith their mouth they speak proudly. ",
 "They have now surrounded us in our steps. \nThey set their eyes to cast us down to the earth. ",
 "He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, \nas it were a young lion lurking in secret places. ",
 "Arise, Yahweh, confront him. \nCast him down. \nDeliver my soul from the wicked by your sword; ",
 "from men by your hand, Yahweh, \nfrom men of the world, whose portion is in this life. \nYou fill the belly of your cherished ones. \nYour sons have plenty, \nand they store up wealth for their children. ",
 "As for me, I shall see your face in righteousness. \nI shall be satisfied, when I awake, with seeing your form. "
