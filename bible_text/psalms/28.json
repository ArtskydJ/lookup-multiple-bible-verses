 " \nTo you, Yahweh, I call. \nMy rock, don’t be deaf to me, \nlest, if you are silent to me, \nI would become like those who go down into the pit. ",
 "Hear the voice of my petitions, when I cry to you, \nwhen I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place. ",
 "Don’t draw me away with the wicked, \nwith the workers of iniquity who speak peace with their neighbors, \nbut mischief is in their hearts. ",
 "Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings. \nGive them according to the operation of their hands. \nBring back on them what they deserve. ",
 "Because they don’t respect the works of Yahweh, \nnor the operation of his hands, \nhe will break them down and not build them up. \n ",
 "Blessed be Yahweh, \nbecause he has heard the voice of my petitions. ",
 "Yahweh is my strength and my shield. \nMy heart has trusted in him, and I am helped. \nTherefore my heart greatly rejoices. \nWith my song I will thank him. ",
 "Yahweh is their strength. \nHe is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed. ",
 "Save your people, \nand bless your inheritance. \nBe their shepherd also, \nand bear them up forever. "
