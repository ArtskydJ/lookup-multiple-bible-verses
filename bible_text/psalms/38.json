 " \nYahweh, don’t rebuke me in your wrath, \nneither chasten me in your hot displeasure. ",
 "For your arrows have pierced me, \nyour hand presses hard on me. ",
 "There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation, \nneither is there any health in my bones because of my sin. ",
 "For my iniquities have gone over my head. \nAs a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me. ",
 "My wounds are loathsome and corrupt \nbecause of my foolishness. ",
 "I am in pain and bowed down greatly. \nI go mourning all day long. ",
 "For my waist is filled with burning. \nThere is no soundness in my flesh. ",
 "I am faint and severely bruised. \nI have groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart. ",
 "Lord, all my desire is before you. \nMy groaning is not hidden from you. ",
 "My heart throbs. \nMy strength fails me. \nAs for the light of my eyes, it has also left me. ",
 "My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague. \nMy kinsmen stand far away. ",
 "They also who seek after my life lay snares. \nThose who seek my hurt speak mischievous things, \nand meditate deceits all day long. ",
 "But I, as a deaf man, don’t hear. \nI am as a mute man who doesn’t open his mouth. ",
 "Yes, I am as a man who doesn’t hear, \nin whose mouth are no reproofs. ",
 "For I hope in you, Yahweh. \nYou will answer, Lord my God. ",
 "For I said, “Don’t let them gloat over me, \nor exalt themselves over me when my foot slips.” ",
 "For I am ready to fall. \nMy pain is continually before me. ",
 "For I will declare my iniquity. \nI will be sorry for my sin. ",
 "But my enemies are vigorous and many. \nThose who hate me without reason are numerous. ",
 "They who render evil for good are also adversaries to me, \nbecause I follow what is good. ",
 "Don’t forsake me, Yahweh. \nMy God, don’t be far from me. ",
 "Hurry to help me, \nLord, my salvation. "
