 " \nIsrael, return to Yahweh your God; \nfor you have fallen because of your sin. ",
 "Take words with you, and return to Yahweh. \nTell him, “Forgive all our sins, \nand accept that which is good: \nso we offer our lips like bulls. ",
 "Assyria can’t save us. \nWe won’t ride on horses; \nneither will we say any more to the work of our hands, ‘Our gods!’ \nfor in you the fatherless finds mercy.” \n ",
 "“I will heal their waywardness. \nI will love them freely; \nfor my anger is turned away from him. ",
 "I will be like the dew to Israel. \nHe will blossom like the lily, \nand send down his roots like Lebanon. ",
 "His branches will spread, \nand his beauty will be like the olive tree, \nand his fragrance like Lebanon. ",
 "Men will dwell in his shade. \nThey will revive like the grain, \nand blossom like the vine. \nTheir fragrance will be like the wine of Lebanon. ",
 "Ephraim, what have I to do any more with idols? \nI answer, and will take care of him. \nI am like a green cypress tree; \nfrom me your fruit is found.” \n ",
 "Who is wise, that he may understand these things? \nWho is prudent, that he may know them? \nFor the ways of Yahweh are right, \nand the righteous walk in them; \nBut the rebellious stumble in them. "
