 " \nYahweh, who shall dwell in your sanctuary? \nWho shall live on your holy hill? ",
 "He who walks blamelessly and does what is right, \nand speaks truth in his heart; ",
 "he who doesn’t slander with his tongue, \nnor does evil to his friend, \nnor casts slurs against his fellow man; ",
 "in whose eyes a vile man is despised, \nbut who honors those who fear Yahweh; \nhe who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and doesn’t change; ",
 "he who doesn’t lend out his money for usury, \nnor take a bribe against the innocent. \nHe who does these things shall never be shaken. "
