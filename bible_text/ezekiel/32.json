 "In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, “Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  ",
 "‘Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and tell him, \n“You were likened to a young lion of the nations; \nyet you are as a monster in the seas. \nYou broke out with your rivers, \nand troubled the waters with your feet, \nand fouled their rivers.” ",
 "The Lord Yahweh says: \n“I will spread out my net on you with a company of many peoples; \nand they will bring you up in my net. ",
 "I will leave you on the land. \nI will cast you out on the open field, \nand will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you. \nI will satisfy the animals of the whole earth with you. ",
 "I will lay your flesh on the mountains, \nand fill the valleys with your height. ",
 "I will also water the land in which you swim with your blood, \neven to the mountains. \nThe watercourses will be full of you. ",
 "When I extinguish you, I will cover the heavens \nand make its stars dark. \nI will cover the sun with a cloud, \nand the moon won’t give its light. ",
 "I will make all the bright lights of the sky dark over you, \nand set darkness on your land,” says the Lord Yahweh. ",
 "“I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples, \nwhen I bring your destruction among the nations, \ninto the countries which you have not known. ",
 "Yes, I will make many peoples amazed at you, \nand their kings will be horribly afraid for you, \nwhen I brandish my sword before them. \nThey will tremble at every moment, \nevery man for his own life, \nin the day of your fall.” ",
 "For the Lord Yahweh says: \n“The sword of the king of Babylon will come on you. ",
 "I will cause your multitude to fall by the swords of the mighty. \nThey are all the ruthless of the nations. \nThey will bring the pride of Egypt to nothing, \nand all its multitude will be destroyed. ",
 "I will destroy also all its animals from beside many waters. \nThe foot of man won’t trouble them any more, \nnor will the hoofs of animals trouble them. ",
 "Then I will make their waters clear, \nand cause their rivers to run like oil,” \nsays the Lord Yahweh. ",
 "“When I make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, \na land destitute of that of which it was full, \nwhen I strike all those who dwell therein, \nthen they will know that I am Yahweh. ",
 "“ ‘ “This is the lamentation with which they will lament. The daughters of the nations will lament with this. They will lament with it over Egypt, and over all her multitude,” says the Lord Yahweh.’ ” ",
 "Also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  ",
 "“Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her and the daughters of the famous nations, to the lower parts of the earth, with those who go down into the pit.  ",
 "Whom do you pass in beauty? Go down, and be laid with the uncircumcised.  ",
 "They will fall among those who are slain by the sword. She is delivered to the sword. Draw her away with all her multitudes.  ",

 "“Asshur is there with all her company. Her graves are all around her. All of them slain, fallen by the sword;  ",

 "“There is Elam and all her multitude around her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who have gone down uncircumcised into the lower parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with those who go down to the pit.  ",
 "They have set her a bed among the slain with all her multitude. Her graves are around her; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for their terror was caused in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with those who go down to the pit. He is put among those who are slain. ",
 "“There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude. Their graves are around them, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for they caused their terror in the land of the living.  ",
 "They will not lie with the mighty who are fallen of the uncircumcised, who have gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads, and their iniquities are on their bones; for they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living. ",
 "“But you will be broken among the uncircumcised, and will lie with those who are slain by the sword. ",
