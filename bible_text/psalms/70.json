 " \nHurry, God, to deliver me. \nCome quickly to help me, Yahweh. ",
 "Let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul. \nLet those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace. ",
 "Let them be turned because of their shame \nwho say, “Aha! Aha!” ",
 "Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. \nLet those who love your salvation continually say, \n“Let God be exalted!” ",
 "But I am poor and needy. \nCome to me quickly, God. \nYou are my help and my deliverer. \nYahweh, don’t delay. "
