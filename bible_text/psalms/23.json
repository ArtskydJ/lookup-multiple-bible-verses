 " \nYahweh is my shepherd: \nI shall lack nothing. ",
 "He makes me lie down in green pastures. \nHe leads me beside still waters. ",
 "He restores my soul. \nHe guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. ",
 "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, \nI will fear no evil, for you are with me. \nYour rod and your staff, \nthey comfort me. ",
 "You prepare a table before me \nin the presence of my enemies. \nYou anoint my head with oil. \nMy cup runs over. ",
 "Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life, \nand I will dwell in Yahweh’s house forever. "
