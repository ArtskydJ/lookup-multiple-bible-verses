 " \nWhen Yahweh brought back those who returned to Zion, \nwe were like those who dream. ",
 "Then our mouth was filled with laughter, \nand our tongue with singing. \nThen they said among the nations, \n“Yahweh has done great things for them.” ",
 "Yahweh has done great things for us, \nand we are glad. ",
 "Restore our fortunes again, Yahweh, \nlike the streams in the Negev. ",
 "Those who sow in tears will reap in joy. ",
 "He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing, \nwill certainly come again with joy, carrying his sheaves. "
