 " \nYahweh, how my adversaries have increased! \nMany are those who rise up against me. ",
 "Many there are who say of my soul, \n“There is no help for him in God.” ",
 "But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me, \nmy glory, and the one who lifts up my head. ",
 "I cry to Yahweh with my voice, \nand he answers me out of his holy hill. ",
 "I laid myself down and slept. \nI awakened; for Yahweh sustains me. ",
 "I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people \nwho have set themselves against me on every side. ",
 "Arise, Yahweh! \nSave me, my God! \nFor you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone. \nYou have broken the teeth of the wicked. ",
 "Salvation belongs to Yahweh. \nMay your blessing be on your people. "
