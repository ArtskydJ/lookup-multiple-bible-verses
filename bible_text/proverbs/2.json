 " \nMy son, if you will receive my words, \nand store up my commandments within you, ",
 "so as to turn your ear to wisdom, \nand apply your heart to understanding; ",
 "yes, if you call out for discernment, \nand lift up your voice for understanding; ",
 "if you seek her as silver, \nand search for her as for hidden treasures: ",
 "then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, \nand find the knowledge of God. ",
 "For Yahweh gives wisdom. \nOut of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding. ",
 "He lays up sound wisdom for the upright. \nHe is a shield to those who walk in integrity, ",
 "that he may guard the paths of justice, \nand preserve the way of his saints. ",
 "Then you will understand righteousness and justice, \nequity and every good path. ",
 "For wisdom will enter into your heart. \nKnowledge will be pleasant to your soul. ",
 "Discretion will watch over you. \nUnderstanding will keep you, ",
 "to deliver you from the way of evil, \nfrom the men who speak perverse things, ",
 "who forsake the paths of uprightness, \nto walk in the ways of darkness, ",
 "who rejoice to do evil, \nand delight in the perverseness of evil, ",
 "who are crooked in their ways, \nand wayward in their paths, ",
 "to deliver you from the strange woman, \neven from the foreigner who flatters with her words, ",
 "who forsakes the friend of her youth, \nand forgets the covenant of her God; ",
 "for her house leads down to death, \nher paths to the departed spirits. ",
 "None who go to her return again, \nneither do they attain to the paths of life. ",
 "So you may walk in the way of good men, \nand keep the paths of the righteous. ",
 "For the upright will dwell in the land. \nThe perfect will remain in it. ",
 "But the wicked will be cut off from the land. \nThe treacherous will be rooted out of it. "
