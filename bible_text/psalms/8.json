 " \nYahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! \nYou have set your glory above the heavens! ",
 "From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength, \nbecause of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy and the avenger. ",
 "When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, \nthe moon and the stars, which you have ordained; ",
 "what is man, that you think of him? \nWhat is the son of man, that you care for him? ",
 "For you have made him a little lower than the angels, \nand crowned him with glory and honor. ",
 "You make him ruler over the works of your hands. \nYou have put all things under his feet: ",
 "All sheep and cattle, \nyes, and the animals of the field, ",
 "the birds of the sky, the fish of the sea, \nand whatever passes through the paths of the seas. ",
 "Yahweh, our Lord, \nhow majestic is your name in all the earth! "
