 " \nThe fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.” \nThey are corrupt. \nThey have done abominable deeds. \nThere is no one who does good. ",
 "Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men, \nto see if there were any who understood, \nwho sought after God. ",
 "They have all gone aside. \nThey have together become corrupt. \nThere is no one who does good, no, not one. ",
 "Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, \nwho eat up my people as they eat bread, \nand don’t call on Yahweh? ",
 "There they were in great fear, \nfor God is in the generation of the righteous. ",
 "You frustrate the plan of the poor, \nbecause Yahweh is his refuge. ",
 "Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! \nWhen Yahweh restores the fortunes of his people, \nthen Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad. "
