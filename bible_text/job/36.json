 "Elihu also continued, and said, \n ",
 "“Bear with me a little, and I will show you; \nfor I still have something to say on God’s behalf. ",
 "I will get my knowledge from afar, \nand will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. ",
 "For truly my words are not false. \nOne who is perfect in knowledge is with you. \n ",
 "“Behold, God is mighty, and doesn’t despise anyone. \nHe is mighty in strength of understanding. ",
 "He doesn’t preserve the life of the wicked, \nbut gives justice to the afflicted. ",
 "He doesn’t withdraw his eyes from the righteous, \nbut with kings on the throne, \nhe sets them forever, and they are exalted. ",
 "If they are bound in fetters, \nand are taken in the cords of afflictions, ",
 "then he shows them their work, \nand their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly. ",
 "He also opens their ears to instruction, \nand commands that they return from iniquity. ",
 "If they listen and serve him, \nthey will spend their days in prosperity, \nand their years in pleasures. ",
 "But if they don’t listen, they will perish by the sword; \nthey will die without knowledge. \n ",
 "“But those who are godless in heart lay up anger. \nThey don’t cry for help when he binds them. ",
 "They die in youth. \nTheir life perishes among the unclean. ",
 "He delivers the afflicted by their affliction, \nand opens their ear in oppression. ",
 "Yes, he would have allured you out of distress, \ninto a wide place, where there is no restriction. \nThat which is set on your table would be full of fatness. \n ",
 "“But you are full of the judgment of the wicked. \nJudgment and justice take hold of you. ",
 "Don’t let riches entice you to wrath, \nneither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside. ",
 "Would your wealth sustain you in distress, \nor all the might of your strength? ",
 "Don’t desire the night, \nwhen people are cut off in their place. ",
 "Take heed, don’t regard iniquity; \nfor you have chosen this rather than affliction. ",
 "Behold, God is exalted in his power. \nWho is a teacher like him? ",
 "Who has prescribed his way for him? \nOr who can say, ‘You have committed unrighteousness?’ \n ",
 "“Remember that you magnify his work, \nabout which men have sung. ",
 "All men have looked on it. \nMan sees it afar off. ",
 "Behold, God is great, and we don’t know him. \nThe number of his years is unsearchable. ",
 "For he draws up the drops of water, \nwhich distill in rain from his vapor, ",
 "which the skies pour down \nand which drop on man abundantly. ",
 "Yes, can any understand the spreading of the clouds, \nand the thunderings of his pavilion? ",
 "Behold, he spreads his light around him. \nHe covers the bottom of the sea. ",
 "For by these he judges the people. \nHe gives food in abundance. ",
 "He covers his hands with the lightning, \nand commands it to strike the mark. ",
 "Its noise tells about him, \nand the livestock also concerning the storm that comes up. "
