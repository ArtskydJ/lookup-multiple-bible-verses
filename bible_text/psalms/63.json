 " \nGod, you are my God. \nI will earnestly seek you. \nMy soul thirsts for you. \nMy flesh longs for you, \nin a dry and weary land, where there is no water. ",
 "So I have seen you in the sanctuary, \nwatching your power and your glory. ",
 "Because your loving kindness is better than life, \nmy lips shall praise you. ",
 "So I will bless you while I live. \nI will lift up my hands in your name. ",
 "My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food. \nMy mouth shall praise you with joyful lips, ",
 "when I remember you on my bed, \nand think about you in the night watches. ",
 "For you have been my help. \nI will rejoice in the shadow of your wings. ",
 "My soul stays close to you. \nYour right hand holds me up. ",
 "But those who seek my soul to destroy it \nshall go into the lower parts of the earth. ",
 "They shall be given over to the power of the sword. \nThey shall be jackal food. ",
 "But the king shall rejoice in God. \nEveryone who swears by him will praise him, \nfor the mouth of those who speak lies shall be silenced. "
