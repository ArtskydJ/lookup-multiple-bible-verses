 "I said, \n“Please listen, you heads of Jacob, \nand rulers of the house of Israel: \nIsn’t it for you to know justice? ",
 "You who hate the good, \nand love the evil; \nwho tear off their skin, \nand their flesh from off their bones; ",
 "who also eat the flesh of my people, \nand peel their skin from off them, \nand break their bones, \nand chop them in pieces, as for the pot, \nand as meat within the cauldron. ",
 "Then they will cry to Yahweh, \nbut he will not answer them. \nYes, he will hide his face from them at that time, \nbecause they made their deeds evil.” ",
 "Yahweh says concerning the prophets who lead my people astray; for those who feed their teeth, they proclaim, “Peace!” and whoever doesn’t provide for their mouths, they prepare war against him: \n ",
 "“Therefore night is over you, with no vision, \nand it is dark to you, that you may not divine; \nand the sun will go down on the prophets, \nand the day will be black over them. ",
 "The seers shall be disappointed, \nand the diviners confounded. \nYes, they shall all cover their lips; \nfor there is no answer from God.” ",
 "But as for me, I am full of power by Yahweh’s Spirit, \nand of judgment, and of might, \nto declare to Jacob his disobedience, \nand to Israel his sin. ",
 "Please listen to this, you heads of the house of Jacob, \nand rulers of the house of Israel, \nwho abhor justice, \nand pervert all equity. ",
 "They build up Zion with blood, \nand Jerusalem with iniquity. ",
 "Her leaders judge for bribes, \nand her priests teach for a price, \nand her prophets of it tell fortunes for money: \nyet they lean on Yahweh, and say, \n“Isn’t Yahweh among us? \nNo disaster will come on us.” ",
 "Therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field, \nand Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble, \nand the mountain of the temple like the high places of a forest. "
