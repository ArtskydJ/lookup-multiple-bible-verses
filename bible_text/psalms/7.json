 " \nYahweh, my God, I take refuge in you. \nSave me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me, ",
 "lest they tear apart my soul like a lion, \nripping it in pieces, while there is no one to deliver. ",
 "Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, \nif there is iniquity in my hands, ",
 "if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me \n(yes, I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary), ",
 "let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; \nyes, let him tread my life down to the earth, \nand lay my glory in the dust. ",
 "Arise, Yahweh, in your anger. \nLift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries. \nAwake for me. You have commanded judgment. ",
 "Let the congregation of the peoples surround you. \nRule over them on high. ",
 "Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples. \nJudge me, Yahweh, according to my righteousness, \nand to my integrity that is in me. ",
 "Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, \nbut establish the righteous; \ntheir minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God. ",
 "My shield is with God, \nwho saves the upright in heart. ",
 "God is a righteous judge, \nyes, a God who has indignation every day. ",
 "If a man doesnâ€™t repent, he will sharpen his sword; \nhe has bent and strung his bow. ",
 "He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death. \nHe makes ready his flaming arrows. ",
 "Behold, he travails with iniquity. \nYes, he has conceived mischief, \nand brought out falsehood. ",
 "He has dug a hole, \nand has fallen into the pit which he made. ",
 "The trouble he causes shall return to his own head. \nHis violence shall come down on the crown of his own head. ",
 "I will give thanks to Yahweh according to his righteousness, \nand will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High. "
