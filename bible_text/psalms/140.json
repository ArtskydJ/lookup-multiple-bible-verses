 " \nDeliver me, Yahweh, from the evil man. \nPreserve me from the violent man: ",
 "those who devise mischief in their hearts. \nThey continually gather themselves together for war. ",
 "They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent. \nViper’s poison is under their lips. ",
 "Yahweh, keep me from the hands of the wicked. \nPreserve me from the violent men who have determined to trip my feet. ",
 "The proud have hidden a snare for me, \nthey have spread the cords of a net by the path. \nThey have set traps for me. ",
 "I said to Yahweh, “You are my God.” \nListen to the cry of my petitions, Yahweh. ",
 "Yahweh, the Lord, the strength of my salvation, \nyou have covered my head in the day of battle. ",
 "Yahweh, don’t grant the desires of the wicked. \nDon’t let their evil plans succeed, or they will become proud. ",
 "As for the head of those who surround me, \nlet the mischief of their own lips cover them. ",
 "Let burning coals fall on them. \nLet them be thrown into the fire, \ninto miry pits, from where they never rise. ",
 "An evil speaker won’t be established in the earth. \nEvil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him. ",
 "I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted, \nand justice for the needy. ",
 "Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name. \nThe upright will dwell in your presence. "
