 " \nYahweh reigns! \nLet the earth rejoice! \nLet the multitude of islands be glad! ",
 "Clouds and darkness are around him. \nRighteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. ",
 "A fire goes before him, \nand burns up his adversaries on every side. ",
 "His lightning lights up the world. \nThe earth sees, and trembles. ",
 "The mountains melt like wax at the presence of Yahweh, \nat the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. ",
 "The heavens declare his righteousness. \nAll the peoples have seen his glory. ",
 "Let all them be shamed who serve engraved images, \nwho boast in their idols. \nWorship him, all you gods! ",
 "Zion heard and was glad. \nThe daughters of Judah rejoiced \nbecause of your judgments, Yahweh. ",
 "For you, Yahweh, are most high above all the earth. \nYou are exalted far above all gods. ",
 "You who love Yahweh, hate evil! \nHe preserves the souls of his saints. \nHe delivers them out of the hand of the wicked. ",
 "Light is sown for the righteous, \nand gladness for the upright in heart. ",
 "Be glad in Yahweh, you righteous people! \nGive thanks to his holy Name. "
