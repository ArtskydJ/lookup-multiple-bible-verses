 " \n“My soul is weary of my life. \nI will give free course to my complaint. \nI will speak in the bitterness of my soul. ",
 "I will tell God, ‘Do not condemn me. \nShow me why you contend with me. ",
 "Is it good to you that you should oppress, \nthat you should despise the work of your hands, \nand smile on the counsel of the wicked? ",
 "Do you have eyes of flesh? \nOr do you see as man sees? ",
 "Are your days as the days of mortals, \nor your years as man’s years, ",
 "that you inquire after my iniquity, \nand search after my sin? ",
 "Although you know that I am not wicked, \nthere is no one who can deliver out of your hand. \n ",
 "“ ‘Your hands have framed me and fashioned me altogether, \nyet you destroy me. ",
 "Remember, I beg you, that you have fashioned me as clay. \nWill you bring me into dust again? ",
 "Haven’t you poured me out like milk, \nand curdled me like cheese? ",
 "You have clothed me with skin and flesh, \nand knit me together with bones and sinews. ",
 "You have granted me life and loving kindness. \nYour visitation has preserved my spirit. ",
 "Yet you hid these things in your heart. \nI know that this is with you: ",
 "if I sin, then you mark me. \nYou will not acquit me from my iniquity. ",
 "If I am wicked, woe to me. \nIf I am righteous, I still will not lift up my head, \nbeing filled with disgrace, \nand conscious of my affliction. ",
 "If my head is held high, you hunt me like a lion. \nAgain you show yourself powerful to me. ",
 "You renew your witnesses against me, \nand increase your indignation on me. \nChanges and warfare are with me. \n ",
 "“ ‘Why, then, have you brought me out of the womb? \nI wish I had given up the spirit, and no eye had seen me. ",
 "I should have been as though I had not been. \nI should have been carried from the womb to the grave. ",
 "Aren’t my days few? \nStop! \nLeave me alone, that I may find a little comfort, ",
 "before I go where I will not return from, \nto the land of darkness and of the shadow of death; ",
 "the land dark as midnight, \nof the shadow of death, \nwithout any order, \nwhere the light is as midnight.’ ” "
