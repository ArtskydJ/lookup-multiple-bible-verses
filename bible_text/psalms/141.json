 "Set a watch, Yahweh, before my mouth. \nKeep the door of my lips. ",
 "Don’t incline my heart to any evil thing, \nto practice deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity. \nDon’t let me eat of their delicacies. ",
 "Let the righteous strike me, it is kindness; \nlet him reprove me, it is like oil on the head; \ndon’t let my head refuse it; \nYet my prayer is always against evil deeds. ",
 "Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock. \nThey will hear my words, for they are well spoken. ",

 "For my eyes are on you, Yahweh, the Lord. \nIn you, I take refuge. \nDon’t leave my soul destitute. ",
 "Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, \nfrom the traps of the workers of iniquity. ",
 "Let the wicked fall together into their own nets \nwhile I pass by. "
