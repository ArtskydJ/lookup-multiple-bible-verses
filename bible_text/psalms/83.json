 " \nGod, don’t keep silent. \nDon’t keep silent, \nand don’t be still, God. ",
 "For, behold, your enemies are stirred up. \nThose who hate you have lifted up their heads. ",
 "They conspire with cunning against your people. \nThey plot against your cherished ones. ",
 "“Come,” they say, “let’s destroy them as a nation, \nthat the name of Israel may be remembered no more.” ",
 "For they have conspired together with one mind. \nThey form an alliance against you. ",
 "The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; \nMoab, and the Hagrites; ",
 "Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; \nPhilistia with the inhabitants of Tyre; ",
 "Assyria also is joined with them. \nThey have helped the children of Lot. ",
 "Do to them as you did to Midian, \nas to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon; ",
 "who perished at Endor, \nwho became as dung for the earth. ",
 "Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, \nyes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna, ",
 "who said, “Let’s take possession of God’s pasture lands.” ",
 "My God, make them like tumbleweed, \nlike chaff before the wind. ",
 "As the fire that burns the forest, \nas the flame that sets the mountains on fire, ",
 "so pursue them with your tempest, \nand terrify them with your storm. ",
 "Fill their faces with confusion, \nthat they may seek your name, Yahweh. ",
 "Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever. \nYes, let them be confounded and perish; ",
 "that they may know that you alone, whose name is Yahweh, \nare the Most High over all the earth. "
