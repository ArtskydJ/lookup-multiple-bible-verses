 "Yahweh says, \n“Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. \nWhat kind of house will you build to me? \nWhere will I rest? ",
 "For my hand has made all these things, \nand so all these things came to be,” says Yahweh: \n“but I will look to this man, \neven to he who is poor and of a contrite spirit, \nand who trembles at my word. ",
 "He who kills an ox is as he who kills a man; \nhe who sacrifices a lamb, as he who breaks a dog’s neck; \nhe who offers an offering, as he who offers pig’s blood; \nhe who burns frankincense, as he who blesses an idol. \nYes, they have chosen their own ways, \nand their soul delights in their abominations: ",
 "I also will choose their delusions, \nand will bring their fears on them; \nbecause when I called, no one answered; \nwhen I spoke, they didn’t listen; \nbut they did that which was evil in my eyes, \nand chose that in which I didn’t delight.” \n ",
 "Hear Yahweh’s word, \nyou who tremble at his word: \n“Your brothers who hate you, \nwho cast you out for my name’s sake, have said, \n‘Let Yahweh be glorified, \nthat we may see your joy;’ \nbut it is those who shall be disappointed. ",
 "A voice of tumult from the city, \na voice from the temple, \na voice of Yahweh that repays his enemies what they deserve. \n ",
 "“Before she travailed, she gave birth. \nBefore her pain came, she delivered a son. ",
 "Who has heard of such a thing? \nWho has seen such things? \nShall a land be born in one day? \nShall a nation be born at once? \nFor as soon as Zion travailed, \nshe gave birth to her children. ",
 "Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to be delivered?” says Yahweh. \n“Shall I who cause to give birth shut the womb?” says your God. \n ",
 "“Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you who love her. \nRejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn over her; ",
 "that you may nurse and be satisfied at the comforting breasts; \nthat you may drink deeply, \nand be delighted with the abundance of her glory.” \n ",
 "For Yahweh says, “Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, \nand the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream; \nand you will nurse. \nYou will be carried on her side, \nand will be dandled on her knees. ",
 "As one whom his mother comforts, \nso I will comfort you. \nYou will be comforted in Jerusalem.” \n ",
 "You will see it, and your heart shall rejoice, \nand your bones will flourish like the tender grass. \nYahweh’s hand will be known among his servants; \nand he will have indignation against his enemies. \n ",
 "For, behold, Yahweh will come with fire, \nand his chariots will be like the whirlwind; \nto render his anger with fierceness, \nand his rebuke with flames of fire. ",
 "For Yahweh will execute judgment by fire and by his sword on all flesh; \nand those slain by Yahweh will be many. ",
 "“Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves to go to the gardens, behind one in the middle, eating pig’s meat, abominable things, and the mouse, they shall come to an end together,” says Yahweh. ",
 "“For I know their works and their thoughts. The time comes that I will gather all nations and languages, and they will come, and will see my glory. ",
 "“I will set a sign among them, and I will send those who escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to far-away islands, who have not heard my fame, nor have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the nations.  ",
 "They shall bring all your brothers out of all the nations for an offering to Yahweh, on horses, in chariots, in litters, on mules, and on camels, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says Yahweh, as the children of Israel bring their offering in a clean vessel into Yahweh’s house.  ",
 "Of them I will also select priests and Levites,” says Yahweh. ",
 "“For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me,” says Yahweh, “so your offspring and your name shall remain.  ",
 "It shall happen that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, all flesh will come to worship before me,” says Yahweh.  ",
 "“They will go out, and look at the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against me; for their worm will not die, nor will their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind.” "
