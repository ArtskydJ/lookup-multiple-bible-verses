 " \nYahweh says, “Where is the bill of your mother’s divorce, with which I have put her away? \nOr to which of my creditors have I sold you? \nBehold, you were sold for your iniquities, \nand your mother was put away for your transgressions. ",
 "Why, when I came, was there no one? \nWhen I called, why was there no one to answer? \nIs my hand shortened at all, that it can’t redeem? \nOr have I no power to deliver? \nBehold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea. \nI make the rivers a wilderness. \nTheir fish stink because there is no water, and die of thirst. ",
 "I clothe the heavens with blackness. \nI make sackcloth their covering.” \n ",
 "The Lord Yahweh has given me the tongue of those who are taught, \nthat I may know how to sustain with words him who is weary. \nHe awakens morning by morning, \nhe awakens my ear to hear as those who are taught. ",
 "The Lord Yahweh has opened my ear. \nI was not rebellious. \nI have not turned back. ",
 "I gave my back to those who beat me, \nand my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair. \nI didn’t hide my face from shame and spitting. ",
 "For the Lord Yahweh will help me. \nTherefore I have not been confounded. \nTherefore I have set my face like a flint, \nand I know that I won’t be disappointed. ",
 "He who justifies me is near. \nWho will bring charges against me? \nLet us stand up together. \nWho is my adversary? \nLet him come near to me. ",
 "Behold, the Lord Yahweh will help me! \nWho is he who will condemn me? \nBehold, they will all grow old like a garment. \nThe moths will eat them up. \n ",
 "Who among you fears Yahweh \nand obeys the voice of his servant? \nHe who walks in darkness \nand has no light, \nlet him trust in Yahweh’s name, \nand rely on his God. ",
 "Behold, all you who kindle a fire, \nwho adorn yourselves with torches around yourselves, \nwalk in the flame of your fire, \nand among the torches that you have kindled. \nYou will have this from my hand: \nyou will lie down in sorrow. "
