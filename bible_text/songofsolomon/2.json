 " \nI am a rose of Sharon, \na lily of the valleys. ",
 "As a lily among thorns, \nso is my love among the daughters. ",
 "As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, \nso is my beloved among the sons. \nI sat down under his shadow with great delight, \nhis fruit was sweet to my taste. ",
 "He brought me to the banquet hall. \nHis banner over me is love. ",
 "Strengthen me with raisins, \nrefresh me with apples; \nfor I am faint with love. ",
 "His left hand is under my head. \nHis right hand embraces me. ",
 "I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, \nby the roes, or by the hinds of the field, \nthat you not stir up, nor awaken love, \nuntil it so desires. \n ",
 "The voice of my beloved! \nBehold, he comes, \nleaping on the mountains, \nskipping on the hills. ",
 "My beloved is like a roe or a young deer. \nBehold, he stands behind our wall! \nHe looks in at the windows. \nHe glances through the lattice. \n ",
 "My beloved spoke, and said to me, \n“Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away. ",
 "For behold, the winter is past. \nThe rain is over and gone. ",
 "The flowers appear on the earth. \nThe time of the singing has come, \nand the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. ",
 "The fig tree ripens her green figs. \nThe vines are in blossom. \nThey give out their fragrance. \nArise, my love, my beautiful one, \nand come away.” ",
 "My dove in the clefts of the rock, \nin the hiding places of the mountainside, \nlet me see your face. \nlet me hear your voice; \nfor your voice is sweet and your face is lovely. ",
 "Catch for us the foxes, \nthe little foxes that plunder the vineyards; \nfor our vineyards are in blossom. ",
 "My beloved is mine, and I am his. \nHe browses among the lilies. ",
 "Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, \nturn, my beloved, \nand be like a roe or a young deer on the mountains of Bether. "
