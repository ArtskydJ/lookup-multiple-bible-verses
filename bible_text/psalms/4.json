 " \nAnswer me when I call, God of my righteousness. \nGive me relief from my distress. \nHave mercy on me, and hear my prayer. ",
 "You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? \nWill you love vanity and seek after falsehood? ",
 "But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly: \nYahweh will hear when I call to him. ",
 "Stand in awe, and don’t sin. \nSearch your own heart on your bed, and be still. ",
