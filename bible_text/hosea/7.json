 "When I would heal Israel, \nthen the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered, \nalso the wickedness of Samaria; \nfor they commit falsehood, \nand the thief enters in, \nand the gang of robbers ravages outside. ",
 "They don’t consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness. \nNow their own deeds have engulfed them. \nThey are before my face. ",
 "They make the king glad with their wickedness, \nand the princes with their lies. ",
 "They are all adulterers. \nThey are burning like an oven that the baker stops stirring, \nfrom the kneading of the dough, until it is leavened. ",
 "On the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine. \nHe joined his hand with mockers. ",
 "For they have prepared their heart like an oven, \nwhile they lie in wait. \nTheir baker sleeps all the night. \nIn the morning it burns as a flaming fire. ",
 "They are all hot as an oven, \nand devour their judges. \nAll their kings have fallen. \nThere is no one among them who calls to me. ",
 "Ephraim, he mixes himself among the nations. \nEphraim is a pancake not turned over. ",
 "Strangers have devoured his strength, \nand he doesn’t realize it. \nIndeed, gray hairs are here and there on him, \nand he doesn’t realize it. ",
 "The pride of Israel testifies to his face; \nyet they haven’t returned to Yahweh their God, \nnor sought him, for all this. \n ",
 "“Ephraim is like an easily deceived dove, without understanding. \nThey call to Egypt. \nThey go to Assyria. ",
 "When they go, I will spread my net on them. \nI will bring them down like the birds of the sky. \nI will chastise them, as their congregation has heard. ",
 "Woe to them! \nFor they have wandered from me. \nDestruction to them! \nFor they have trespassed against me. \nThough I would redeem them, \nyet they have spoken lies against me. ",
 "They haven’t cried to me with their heart, \nbut they howl on their beds. \nThey assemble themselves for grain and new wine. \nThey turn away from me. ",
 "Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, \nyet they plot evil against me. ",
 "They return, but not to the Most High. \nThey are like a faulty bow. \nTheir princes will fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue. \nThis will be their derision in the land of Egypt. "
