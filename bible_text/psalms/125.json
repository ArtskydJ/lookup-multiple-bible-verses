 " \nThose who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion, \nwhich can’t be moved, but remains forever. ",
 "As the mountains surround Jerusalem, \nso Yahweh surrounds his people from this time forward and forever more. ",
 "For the scepter of wickedness won’t remain over the allotment of the righteous; \nso that the righteous won’t use their hands to do evil. ",
 "Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good, \nto those who are upright in their hearts. ",
 "But as for those who turn away to their crooked ways, \nYahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity. \nPeace be on Israel. "
