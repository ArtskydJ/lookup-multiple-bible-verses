 " \nThe wilderness and the dry land will be glad. \nThe desert will rejoice and blossom like a rose. ",
 "It will blossom abundantly, \nand rejoice even with joy and singing. \nLebanon’s glory will be given to it, \nthe excellence of Carmel and Sharon. \nThey will see Yahweh’s glory, \nthe excellence of our God. \n ",
 "Strengthen the weak hands, \nand make the feeble knees firm. ",
 "Tell those who have a fearful heart, “Be strong! \nDon’t be afraid! \nBehold, your God will come with vengeance, God’s retribution. \nHe will come and save you. \n ",
 "Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, \nand the ears of the deaf will be unstopped. ",
 "Then the lame man will leap like a deer, \nand the tongue of the mute will sing; \nfor waters will break out in the wilderness, \nand streams in the desert. ",
 "The burning sand will become a pool, \nand the thirsty ground springs of water. \nGrass with reeds and rushes will be in the habitation of jackals, where they lay. ",
 "A highway will be there, a road, \nand it will be called “The Holy Way”. \nThe unclean shall not pass over it, \nbut it will be for those who walk in the Way. \nWicked fools shall not go there. ",
 "No lion will be there, \nnor will any ravenous animal go up on it. \nThey will not be found there; \nbut the redeemed will walk there. ",
 "Then Yahweh’s ransomed ones will return, \nand come with singing to Zion; \nand everlasting joy will be on their heads. \nThey will obtain gladness and joy, \nand sorrow and sighing will flee away.” "
