 "Then Job answered, \n ",
 "“How long will you torment me, \nand crush me with words? ",
 "You have reproached me ten times. \nYou aren’t ashamed that you attack me. ",
 "If it is true that I have erred, \nmy error remains with myself. ",
 "If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me, \nand plead against me my reproach, ",
 "know now that God has subverted me, \nand has surrounded me with his net. \n ",
 "“Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard. \nI cry for help, but there is no justice. ",
 "He has walled up my way so that I can’t pass, \nand has set darkness in my paths. ",
 "He has stripped me of my glory, \nand taken the crown from my head. ",
 "He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone. \nHe has plucked my hope up like a tree. ",
 "He has also kindled his wrath against me. \nHe counts me among his adversaries. ",
 "His troops come on together, \nbuild a siege ramp against me, \nand encamp around my tent. \n ",
 "“He has put my brothers far from me. \nMy acquaintances are wholly estranged from me. ",
 "My relatives have gone away. \nMy familiar friends have forgotten me. ",
 "Those who dwell in my house and my maids consider me a stranger. \nI am an alien in their sight. ",
 "I call to my servant, and he gives me no answer. \nI beg him with my mouth. ",
 "My breath is offensive to my wife. \nI am loathsome to the children of my own mother. ",
 "Even young children despise me. \nIf I arise, they speak against me. ",
 "All my familiar friends abhor me. \nThey whom I loved have turned against me. ",
 "My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh. \nI have escaped by the skin of my teeth. \n ",
 "“Have pity on me. Have pity on me, you my friends; \nfor the hand of God has touched me. ",
 "Why do you persecute me as God, \nand are not satisfied with my flesh? \n ",
 "“Oh that my words were now written! \nOh that they were inscribed in a book! ",
 "That with an iron pen and lead \nthey were engraved in the rock forever! ",
 "But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives. \nIn the end, he will stand upon the earth. ",
 "After my skin is destroyed, \nthen I will see God in my flesh, ",
 "whom I, even I, will see on my side. \nMy eyes will see, and not as a stranger. \n“My heart is consumed within me. ",
 "If you say, ‘How we will persecute him!’ \nbecause the root of the matter is found in me, ",
 "be afraid of the sword, \nfor wrath brings the punishments of the sword, \nthat you may know there is a judgment.” "
