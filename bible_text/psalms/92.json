 " \nIt is a good thing to give thanks to Yahweh, \nto sing praises to your name, Most High, ",
 "to proclaim your loving kindness in the morning, \nand your faithfulness every night, ",
 "with the ten-stringed lute, with the harp, \nand with the melody of the lyre. ",
 "For you, Yahweh, have made me glad through your work. \nI will triumph in the works of your hands. ",
 "How great are your works, Yahweh! \nYour thoughts are very deep. ",
 "A senseless man doesn’t know, \nneither does a fool understand this: ",
 "though the wicked spring up as the grass, \nand all the evildoers flourish, \nthey will be destroyed forever. ",
 "But you, Yahweh, are on high forever more. ",
 "For, behold, your enemies, Yahweh, \nfor, behold, your enemies shall perish. \nAll the evildoers will be scattered. ",
 "But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox. \nI am anointed with fresh oil. ",
 "My eye has also seen my enemies. \nMy ears have heard of the wicked enemies who rise up against me. ",
 "The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree. \nHe will grow like a cedar in Lebanon. ",
 "They are planted in Yahweh’s house. \nThey will flourish in our God’s courts. ",
 "They will still produce fruit in old age. \nThey will be full of sap and green, ",
 "to show that Yahweh is upright. \nHe is my rock, \nand there is no unrighteousness in him. "
