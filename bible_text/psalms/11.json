 " \nIn Yahweh, I take refuge. \nHow can you say to my soul, “Flee as a bird to your mountain”? ",
 "For, behold, the wicked bend their bows. \nThey set their arrows on the strings, \nthat they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart. ",
 "If the foundations are destroyed, \nwhat can the righteous do? ",
 "Yahweh is in his holy temple. \nYahweh is on his throne in heaven. \nHis eyes observe. \nHis eyes examine the children of men. ",
 "Yahweh examines the righteous, \nbut his soul hates the wicked and him who loves violence. ",
 "On the wicked he will rain blazing coals; \nfire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup. ",
 "For Yahweh is righteous. \nHe loves righteousness. \nThe upright shall see his face. "
