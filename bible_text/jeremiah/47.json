 "Yahweh’s word that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh struck Gaza. ",
 "Yahweh says: \n“Behold, waters rise up out of the north, \nand will become an overflowing stream, \nand will overflow the land and all that is therein, \nthe city and those who dwell therein. \nThe men will cry, \nand all the inhabitants of the land will wail. ",
 "At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones, \nat the rushing of his chariots, \nat the rumbling of his wheels, \nthe fathers don’t look back to their children \nfor feebleness of hands; ",
 "because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines, \nto cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains; \nfor Yahweh will destroy the Philistines, \nthe remnant of the isle of Caphtor. ",
 "Baldness has come on Gaza; \nAshkelon is brought to nothing, \nthe remnant of their valley: \nhow long will you cut yourself? \n ",
 "“ ‘You sword of Yahweh, how long will it be before you are quiet? \nPut yourself back into your scabbard; \nrest, and be still.’ \n ",
 "“How can you be quiet, \nsince Yahweh has given you a command? \nAgainst Ashkelon, and against the seashore, \nthere has he appointed it.” "
