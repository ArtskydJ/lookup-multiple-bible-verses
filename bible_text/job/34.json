 "Moreover Elihu answered, \n ",
 "“Hear my words, you wise men. \nGive ear to me, you who have knowledge. ",
 "For the ear tries words, \nas the palate tastes food. ",
 "Let us choose for us that which is right. \nLet us know among ourselves what is good. ",
 "For Job has said, ‘I am righteous, \nGod has taken away my right: ",
 "Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar. \nMy wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.’ ",
 "What man is like Job, \nwho drinks scorn like water, ",
 "Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, \nand walks with wicked men? ",
 "For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing \nthat he should delight himself with God.’ \n ",
 "“Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding: \nfar be it from God, that he should do wickedness, \nfrom the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. ",
 "For the work of a man he will render to him, \nand cause every man to find according to his ways. ",
 "Yes surely, God will not do wickedly, \nneither will the Almighty pervert justice. ",
 "Who put him in charge of the earth? \nOr who has appointed him over the whole world? ",
 "If he set his heart on himself, \nif he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath, ",
 "all flesh would perish together, \nand man would turn again to dust. \n ",
 "“If now you have understanding, hear this. \nListen to the voice of my words. ",
 "Should even one who hates justice govern? \nWill you condemn him who is righteous and mighty?— ",
 "Who says to a king, ‘Vile!’ \nor to nobles, ‘Wicked!’? ",
 "He doesn’t respect the persons of princes, \nnor respect the rich more than the poor; \nfor they all are the work of his hands. ",
 "In a moment they die, even at midnight. \nThe people are shaken and pass away. \nThe mighty are taken away without a hand. \n ",
 "“For his eyes are on the ways of a man. \nHe sees all his goings. ",
 "There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, \nwhere the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. ",
 "For he doesn’t need to consider a man further, \nthat he should go before God in judgment. ",
 "He breaks mighty men in pieces in ways past finding out, \nand sets others in their place. ",
 "Therefore he takes knowledge of their works. \nHe overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed. ",
 "He strikes them as wicked men \nin the open sight of others; ",
 "because they turned away from following him, \nand wouldn’t pay attention to any of his ways, ",
 "so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him. \nHe heard the cry of the afflicted. ",
 "When he gives quietness, who then can condemn? \nWhen he hides his face, who then can see him? \nHe is over a nation or a man alike, ",
 "that the godless man may not reign, \nthat there be no one to ensnare the people. \n ",
 "“For has any said to God, \n‘I am guilty, but I will not offend any more. ",
 "Teach me that which I don’t see. \nIf I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’? ",
 "Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it? \nFor you must choose, and not I. \nTherefore speak what you know. ",
 "Men of understanding will tell me, \nyes, every wise man who hears me: ",
 "‘Job speaks without knowledge. \nHis words are without wisdom.’ ",
 "I wish that Job were tried to the end, \nbecause of his answering like wicked men. ",
 "For he adds rebellion to his sin. \nHe claps his hands among us, \nand multiplies his words against God.” "
