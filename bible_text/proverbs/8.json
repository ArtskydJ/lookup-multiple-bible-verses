 " \nDoesn’t wisdom cry out? \nDoesn’t understanding raise her voice? ",
 "On the top of high places by the way, \nwhere the paths meet, she stands. ",
 "Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, \nat the entry doors, she cries aloud: ",
 "“I call to you men! \nI send my voice to the sons of mankind. ",
 "You simple, understand prudence! \nYou fools, be of an understanding heart! ",
 "Hear, for I will speak excellent things. \nThe opening of my lips is for right things. ",

 "All the words of my mouth are in righteousness. \nThere is nothing crooked or perverse in them. ",
 "They are all plain to him who understands, \nright to those who find knowledge. ",
 "Receive my instruction rather than silver, \nknowledge rather than choice gold. ",
 "For wisdom is better than rubies. \nAll the things that may be desired can’t be compared to it. \n ",

 "“Yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his work, \nbefore his deeds of old. ",
 "I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, \nbefore the earth existed. ",
 "When there were no depths, I was born, \nwhen there were no springs abounding with water. ",
 "Before the mountains were settled in place, \nbefore the hills, I was born; ",
 "while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, \nnor the beginning of the dust of the world. ",
 "When he established the heavens, I was there. \nWhen he set a circle on the surface of the deep, ",
 "when he established the clouds above, \nwhen the springs of the deep became strong, ",
 "when he gave to the sea its boundary, \nthat the waters should not violate his commandment, \nwhen he marked out the foundations of the earth, ",
 "then I was the craftsman by his side. \nI was a delight day by day, \nalways rejoicing before him, ",
 "rejoicing in his whole world. \nMy delight was with the sons of men. \n ",
 "“Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, \nfor blessed are those who keep my ways. ",
 "Hear instruction, and be wise. \nDon’t refuse it. ",
 "Blessed is the man who hears me, \nwatching daily at my gates, \nwaiting at my door posts. ",
 "For whoever finds me, finds life, \nand will obtain favor from Yahweh. ",
 "But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul. \nAll those who hate me love death.” "
