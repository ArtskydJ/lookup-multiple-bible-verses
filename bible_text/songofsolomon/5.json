 " \nI have come into my garden, my sister, my bride. \nI have gathered my myrrh with my spice; \nI have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; \nI have drunk my wine with my milk. \nEat, friends! \nDrink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved. ",
 "I was asleep, but my heart was awake. \nIt is the voice of my beloved who knocks: \n“Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; \nfor my head is filled with dew, \nand my hair with the dampness of the night.” ",
 "I have taken off my robe. Indeed, must I put it on? \nI have washed my feet. Indeed, must I soil them? ",
 "My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening. \nMy heart pounded for him. ",
 "I rose up to open for my beloved. \nMy hands dripped with myrrh, \nmy fingers with liquid myrrh, \non the handles of the lock. ",
 "I opened to my beloved; \nbut my beloved left, and had gone away. \nMy heart went out when he spoke. \nI looked for him, but I didn’t find him. \nI called him, but he didn’t answer. ",
 "The watchmen who go about the city found me. \nThey beat me. \nThey bruised me. \nThe keepers of the walls took my cloak away from me. \n ",
 "I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, \nIf you find my beloved, \nthat you tell him that I am faint with love. ",
 "How is your beloved better than another beloved, \nyou fairest among women? \nHow is your beloved better than another beloved, \nthat you do so adjure us? ",
 "My beloved is white and ruddy. \nThe best among ten thousand. ",
 "His head is like the purest gold. \nHis hair is bushy, black as a raven. ",
 "His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks, \nwashed with milk, mounted like jewels. ",
 "His cheeks are like a bed of spices with towers of perfumes. \nHis lips are like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh. ",
 "His hands are like rings of gold set with beryl. \nHis body is like ivory work overlaid with sapphires. ",
 "His legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold. \nHis appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. ",
 "His mouth is sweetness; \nyes, he is altogether lovely. \nThis is my beloved, and this is my friend, \ndaughters of Jerusalem. "
