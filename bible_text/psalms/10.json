 " \nWhy do you stand far off, Yahweh? \nWhy do you hide yourself in times of trouble? ",
 "In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak. \nThey are caught in the schemes that they devise. ",
 "For the wicked boasts of his heart’s cravings. \nHe blesses the greedy and condemns Yahweh. ",
 "The wicked, in the pride of his face, \nhas no room in his thoughts for God. ",
 "His ways are prosperous at all times. \nHe is arrogant, and your laws are far from his sight. \nAs for all his adversaries, he sneers at them. ",
 "He says in his heart, “I shall not be shaken. \nFor generations I shall have no trouble.” ",
 "His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression. \nUnder his tongue is mischief and iniquity. ",
 "He lies in wait near the villages. \nFrom ambushes, he murders the innocent. \nHis eyes are secretly set against the helpless. ",
 "He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush. \nHe lies in wait to catch the helpless. \nHe catches the helpless when he draws him in his net. ",
 "The helpless are crushed. \nThey collapse. \nThey fall under his strength. ",
 "He says in his heart, “God has forgotten. \nHe hides his face. \nHe will never see it.” \n ",
 "Arise, Yahweh! \nGod, lift up your hand! \nDon’t forget the helpless. ",
 "Why does the wicked person condemn God, \nand say in his heart, “God won’t call me into account?” ",

 "Break the arm of the wicked. \nAs for the evil man, seek out his wickedness until you find none. ",
 "Yahweh is King forever and ever! \nThe nations will perish out of his land. ",
 "Yahweh, you have heard the desire of the humble. \nYou will prepare their heart. \nYou will cause your ear to hear, ",
 "to judge the fatherless and the oppressed, \nthat man who is of the earth may terrify no more. "
