 "“Put the trumpet to your lips! \nSomething like an eagle is over Yahweh’s house, \nbecause they have broken my covenant, \nand rebelled against my law. ",
 "They cry to me, ‘My God, we Israel acknowledge you!’ ",
 "Israel has cast off that which is good. \nThe enemy will pursue him. ",
 "They have set up kings, but not by me. \nThey have made princes, and I didn’t approve. \nOf their silver and their gold they have made themselves idols, \nthat they may be cut off. ",
 "Let Samaria throw out his calf idol! \nMy anger burns against them! \nHow long will it be until they are capable of purity? ",
 "For this is even from Israel! \nThe workman made it, and it is no God; \nindeed, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces. ",
 "For they sow the wind, \nand they will reap the whirlwind. \nHe has no standing grain. \nThe stalk will yield no head. \nIf it does yield, strangers will swallow it up. ",
 "Israel is swallowed up. \nNow they are among the nations like a worthless thing. ",
 "For they have gone up to Assyria, \nlike a wild donkey wandering alone. \nEphraim has hired lovers for himself. ",
 "But although they sold themselves among the nations, \nI will now gather them; \nand they begin to waste away because of the oppression of the king of mighty ones. ",
 "Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning, \nthey became for him altars for sinning. ",
 "I wrote for him the many things of my law; \nbut they were regarded as a strange thing. ",
 "As for the sacrifices of my offerings, \nthey sacrifice meat and eat it; \nBut Yahweh doesn’t accept them. \nNow he will remember their iniquity, \nand punish their sins. \nThey will return to Egypt. ",
 "For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces; \nand Judah has multiplied fortified cities; \nbut I will send a fire on his cities, \nand it will devour its fortresses.” "
