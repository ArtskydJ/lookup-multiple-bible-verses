 " \nGod, the nations have come into your inheritance. \nThey have defiled your holy temple. \nThey have laid Jerusalem in heaps. ",
 "They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky, \nthe flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth. ",
 "They have shed their blood like water around Jerusalem. \nThere was no one to bury them. ",
 "We have become a reproach to our neighbors, \na scoffing and derision to those who are around us. ",
 "How long, Yahweh? \nWill you be angry forever? \nWill your jealousy burn like fire? ",
 "Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you, \non the kingdoms that don’t call on your name; ",
 "for they have devoured Jacob, \nand destroyed his homeland. ",
 "Don’t hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us. \nLet your tender mercies speedily meet us, \nfor we are in desperate need. ",
 "Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name. \nDeliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name’s sake. ",
 "Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” \nLet it be known among the nations, before our eyes, \nthat vengeance for your servants’ blood is being poured out. ",
 "Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you. \nAccording to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are sentenced to death. ",
 "Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom \ntheir reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord. ",
 "So we, your people and sheep of your pasture, \nwill give you thanks forever. \nWe will praise you forever, to all generations. "
