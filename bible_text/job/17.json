 " \n“My spirit is consumed. \nMy days are extinct, \nand the grave is ready for me. ",
 "Surely there are mockers with me. \nMy eye dwells on their provocation. \n ",
 "“Now give a pledge. Be collateral for me with yourself. \nWho is there who will strike hands with me? ",
 "For you have hidden their heart from understanding, \nTherefore you will not exalt them. ",
 "He who denounces his friends for plunder, \nEven the eyes of his children will fail. \n ",
 "“But he has made me a byword of the people. \nThey spit in my face. ",
 "My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow. \nAll my members are as a shadow. ",
 "Upright men will be astonished at this. \nThe innocent will stir himself up against the godless. ",
 "Yet the righteous will hold to his way. \nHe who has clean hands will grow stronger and stronger. ",
 "But as for you all, come back. \nI will not find a wise man among you. ",
 "My days are past. \nMy plans are broken off, \nas are the thoughts of my heart. ",
 "They change the night into day, \nsaying ‘The light is near’ in the presence of darkness. ",
 "If I look for Sheol as my house, \nif I have spread my couch in the darkness, ",
 "if I have said to corruption, ‘You are my father;’ \nto the worm, ‘My mother,’ and ‘My sister,’ ",
 "where then is my hope? \nas for my hope, who will see it? ",
 "Shall it go down with me to the gates of Sheol, \nor descend together into the dust?” "
