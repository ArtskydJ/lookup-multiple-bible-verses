 " \nMy soul rests in God alone. \nMy salvation is from him. ",
 "He alone is my rock, my salvation, and my fortress. \nI will never be greatly shaken. ",

 "They fully intend to throw him down from his lofty place. \nThey delight in lies. \nThey bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. ",
 "My soul, wait in silence for God alone, \nfor my expectation is from him. ",
 "He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress. \nI will not be shaken. ",
 "My salvation and my honor is with God. \nThe rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. ",

 "Surely men of low degree are just a breath, \nand men of high degree are a lie. \nIn the balances they will go up. \nThey are together lighter than a breath. ",
 "Don’t trust in oppression. \nDon’t become vain in robbery. \nIf riches increase, \ndon’t set your heart on them. ",
 "God has spoken once; \ntwice I have heard this, \nthat power belongs to God. ",
 "Also to you, Lord, belongs loving kindness, \nfor you reward every man according to his work. "
